The Tetra Pak career meeting, in GaoTian conference room, was held by young 
chinese commitees, with half seats full. 

No attracting presentations, no senior engineers, no top managers, no 
foreign commitees. Just plain, to get 9 trainee from the whole country's 
graduates for Tetra China. 

Today's New People Evening Paper article says Swedians sing high for plain 
spirits. Today may be a example of this culture. A great company, with great 
career, take his plain steps, on the top level. 

Seems interesting.
