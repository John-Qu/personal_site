[^Data Warehouse]: In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), a **data warehouse** (**DW** or **DWH**), also known as an **enterprise data warehouse** (**EDW**), is a system used for [reporting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_reporting) and [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis), and is considered a core component of [business intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence). DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. They store current and historical data in one single place[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse#cite_note-rjmetrics-2) that are used for creating analytical reports for workers throughout the enterprise. The data stored in the warehouse is [uploaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upload) from the [operational systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_system) (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an [operational data store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_data_store) and may require [data cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing)  for additional operations to ensure [data quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality) before it is used in the DW for reporting. [Extract, transform, load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) (ETL) and [extract, load, transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_load,_transform) (E-LT) are the two main approaches used to build a data warehouse system. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse
[^CRM]: **Customer relationship management** (**CRM**) is an approach to managing a company's interaction with current and potential [customers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer). It uses [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis) about customers' history with a company to improve business relationships with customers, specifically focusing on [customer retention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_retention) and ultimately driving [sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales) growth.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#cite_note-1) One important aspect of the CRM approach is the systems of CRM that compile [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#cite_note-2) Through the CRM approach and the systems used to facilitate it, businesses learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater to their needs.
[^What Is Marketing Automation]: Marketing automation is technology that manages marketing processes and multifunctional campaigns, across multiple channels, automatically. - https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/what-is-marketing-automation/  Marketing automation helps marketers streamline their lead generation, segmentation, lead nurturing and lead scoring, customer lifecycle marketing, cross-sell and up-sell, customer retention, and marketing ROI measurement. - https://www.marketo.com/marketing-automation/
[^Redshift database]: A Redshift Database is a cloud-based, big data warehouse solution offered by Amazon. The platform provides a storage system that lets companies store petabytes of data in easy-to-access “clusters” that can be queried in parallel. ... Redshift is designed for big data and can scale easily thanks to its modular node design. - https://www.sisense.com/glossary/redshift-database/
[^ETL]: In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), **extract, transform, load** (**ETL**) is the general procedure of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source(s) or in a different context than the source(s). The ETL process became a popular concept in the 1970s and is often used in [data warehousing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse). [Data extraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_extraction) involves extracting data from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources; [data transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation) processes data by [data cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_cleansing) and transforming them into a proper storage format/structure for the purposes of querying and analysis; finally, data loading describes the insertion of data into the final target database such as an [operational data store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_data_store), a [data mart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mart), [data lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake) or a data warehouse. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load

Onshape is a new business unit inside PTC delivering the first and only SaaS product design platform in the market today. We are looking to rapidly grow and need great people to join our inside sales[^inside sales] team to help get it done. The representative will have Primary Quota[^quota] Responsibility for all SMB sales[^SMB sales] in their territory, including Training, and Consulting Sales in the assigned territory. This role requires a hunter mentality, to drive both transactional-based sales[^Transactional sale vs Consultative sale] and larger, solution-oriented sales. Also, this role includes being responsible for sales process and decision-making strategy in an effort to increase revenue production and quota attainment. Lastly, you will have direct collaboration with technical services engineers to demonstrate technical value to prospects and overcome technical objections throughout the sales process.

[^inside sales]: Inside sales means the sale of products or services by personnel who reach customers through phone, email, or the internet.

[^Transactional sale vs Consultative sale]: A **Transactional sale** is a simple, short-term sale in which the customer already knows what he needs, so little to no product knowledge is required on the sales side. Typically, these are product rather than service-based. Buying criteria usually hinges on price or ease of acquisition. **Consultative selling** is a more complex, long-term process involving collaboration of both buyer and seller, in which the latter must first develop an understanding of the customer’s business, industry, and needs, and then craft a solution to help the customer achieve their objectives. This is usually service or solution-based. - https://www.sitepoint.com/transactional-vs-consultative-selling-knowing-the-difference-makes-all-the-difference/
