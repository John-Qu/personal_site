### You’re probably using the wrong dictionary

#### by James Somers, May 18, 2014

The way I thought you used a dictionary was that you  looked up words you’ve never heard of, or whose sense you’re unsure of.  You would never look up an ordinary word — like *example*, or *sport*, or *magic* — because all you’ll learn is what it means, and that you already know.

Indeed, if you look up those particular words in the dictionary that comes with your computer — on my Mac, it’s the *New Oxford American Dictionary, 3rd Edition* — you’ll be rewarded with… well, there won’t be any reward. The entries are pedestrian:

**example** /igˈzampəl/, n. *a thing characteristic of its kind or illustrating a general rule*.

**sport** /spôrt/, n. *an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against  another or others for entertainment*.

**magic** /ˈmajik/, n. *the power of apparently influencing the course of events by using mysterious or supernatural forces*.

Here, words are boiled to their essence. But that essence is dry,  functional, almost bureaucratically sapped of color or pop, like [high modernist architecture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Pruitt-Igoe-overview.jpg). Which trains you to think of the dictionary as a utility, not a quarry  of good things, not a place you’d go to explore and savor.

Worse, the words themselves take on the character of their  definitions: they are likewise reduced. A delightful word like “fustian” — delightful because of what it means, because of the way it looks and  sounds, because it is unusual in regular speech but not so effete as to  be unusable, is described, efficiently, as “pompous or pretentious  speech or writing.” Not only is this definition (as we’ll see in a  minute) simplistic and basically wrong, it’s just not in the same class, English-wise, as “fustian.” The language is tin-eared and uninspired.  It’s criminal: This is the place where all the words live and the  writing’s no good.

The New Oxford American dictionary, by the way, is not like  singularly bad. Google’s dictionary, the modern Merriam-Webster, the  dictionary at dictionary.com: they’re all like this. They’re all a chore to read. There’s no play, no delight in the language. The definitions  are these desiccated little husks of technocratic meaningese, as if a  word were no more than its coordinates in semantic space.

### John McPhee’s secret weapon

John McPhee — one the great American writers of nonfiction, almost  peerless as a prose stylist — once wrote an essay for the New Yorker  about his process called “[Draft #4](http://jsomers.net/mcphee-draft-no-4.pdf).” He explains that for him, draft #4 is the draft after the painstaking  labor of creation is done, when all that’s left is to punch up the  language, to replace shopworn words and phrases with stuff that sings.

The way you do it, he says, is “you draw a box not only around any  word that does not seem quite right but also around words that fulfill  their assignment but seem to present an opportunity.” You go looking for *le mot juste*.

But where?

“Your destination is the dictionary,” he writes:

> Suppose you sense an opportunity beyond the word “intention.” You  read the dictionary’s thesaurian list of synonyms: “intention, intent,  purpose, design, aim, end, object, objective, goal.” But the dictionary  doesn’t let it go at that. It goes on to tell you the differences all  the way down the line — how each listed word differs from all the  others. Some dictionaries keep themselves trim by just listing synonyms  and not going on to make distinctions. You want the first kind, in which you are not just getting a list of words; you are being told the  differences in their hues, as if you were looking at the stripes in an  awning, each of a subtly different green.

I do not have this first kind of dictionary. In fact I would have  never thought to use a dictionary the way McPhee uses his, and the  simple reason is that I’ve never had a dictionary *worth* using  that way. If you were to look up the word “intention” in my dictionary  here’s all you would see: “a thing intended; an aim or plan.” No, I  don’t think I’ll be punching up my prose with that.

But somehow for McPhee, the dictionary — the dictionary! — was the  fount of fine prose, the first place he’d go to filch a phrase, to steal fire from the gods. So for instance he’d have an idea of something he  wanted to say:

> I grew up in canoes on northern lakes. Thirty years later, I was  trying to choose a word or words that would explain why anyone in a  modern nation would choose to go a long distance by canoe. I was damned  if I was going to call it a sport, but nothing else occurred.

And he’d go, Well, “sport” is kind of clunky, it’s kind of humdrum.  Maybe I can do better. And he’d look up “sport,” and instead of the even more hopelessly banal “an activity involving physical exertion and  skill” that I’d get out of my dictionary, he’d discover this lovely chip of prose: “2. A diversion of the field.” Thus he could write:

> His professed criteria were to take it easy, see some wildlife, and travel light with his bark canoes — nothing more — and one could not  help but lean his way… Travel by canoe is not a necessity, and will  nevermore be the most efficient way to get from one region to another,  or even from one lake to another — anywhere. A canoe trip has become  simply a rite of oneness with certain terrain, a diversion of the field, an act performed not because it is necessary but because there is value in the act itself.

A book where you can enter “sport” and end up with “a diversion of  the field” — this is in fact the opposite of what I’d known a dictionary to be. This is a book that transmutes plain words into language that’s  finer and more vivid and sometimes more rare. No wonder McPhee wrote  with it by his side. No wonder he looked up words he knew, versus words  he didn’t, in a ratio of “at least ninety-nine to one.”

Unfortunately, he never comes out and says exactly which dictionary  he’s getting all this juice out of. But I was desperate to find it. What was this secret book, this dictionary so rich and alive that one of my  favorite writers was using it to make heroic improvements to his  writing?

I did a little sleuthing. It wasn’t so hard with the examples McPhee  gives, and Google. He says, for instance, that in three years of  research for a book about Alaska he’d forgotten to look up the word *Arctic*. He said that his dictionary gave him this: “Pertaining to, or situated under, the northern constellation called the Bear.”

And that turned out to be enough to find it.

### The invention of American English

Noah Webster is not the best-known of the Founding Fathers but he has been called “the father of American scholarship and education.” There’s actually this great [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster#Blue_Backed_Speller) of how he almost singlehandedly invented the very idea of *American* English, defining the native tongue of the new republic, “rescuing” it from “the clamour of pedantry” imposed by the Brits.

He developed a book, the Blue Backed Speller, which was meant to be  something of a complete linguistic education for young American kids,  teaching them in easy increments how to read, spell, and pronounce  words, and bringing them up on a balanced diet of great writing. It  succeeded. It was actually the most popular book of its time; by 1890 it had sold 60 million copies.

But that wasn’t even Webster’s most ambitious project. Certainly it’s not what he became known for. In 1807, he started writing a dictionary, which he called, boldly, *An American Dictionary of the English Language*. He wanted it to be comprehensive, authoritative. Think of that: a man sits down, aiming to capture his language whole.

Dictionaries today are not written this way. In fact it’d be strange even to say that they’re *written*. They are *built* by a large team, less a work of art than of engineering. When you read  an entry you don’t get the sense that a person labored at his desk,  alone, trying to put the essence of that word into words. That is, you  don’t get a sense, the way you do from a good novel, that there was  another mind as alive as yours on the other side of the page.

Webster’s dictionary took him 26 years to finish. It ended up having  70,000 words. He wrote it all himself, including the etymologies, which  required that he learn 28 languages, including Old English, Gothic,  German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Welsh, Russian, Aramaic,  Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit. He was plagued by debt to fund the  project; he had to mortgage his home.

In his own lifetime the dictionary sold poorly and got little  recognition. Today, of course, his name is so synonymous with even the  idea of a dictionary that *Webster* is actually a [genericized trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genericized_trademark) in the U.S., so that other dictionaries *whose contents bear no relation to Webster’s original* can [use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webster) the name just to have the “Webster” brand rub off on them. [1]

\* * *

It makes sense: there was, and is, something remarkable about his  1828 dictionary, and the editions that followed in its line (the New and Revised 1847, the Unabridged 1864, the International 1890 and 1900, the New International 1909, the 1913, etc.). You can see why it became  cliché to start a speech with “Webster’s defines X as…”: with his  dictionary the definition that followed was actually likely to lend  gravitas to your remarks, to sound so good, in fact, that it’d beat  anything you could come up with on your own.

Take a simple word, like “flash.” In all the dictionaries I’ve ever  known, I would have never looked up that word. I’d’ve had no reason to — I already knew what it meant. But go [look up “flash” in Webster’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20160108161120/http://machaut.uchicago.edu:80/websters) (the edition I’m using is the 1913). The first thing you’ll notice is  that the example sentences don’t sound like they came out of a DMV  training manual (“the lights started flashing”) — they come from Milton  and Shakespeare and Tennyson (“A thought flashed through me, which I  clothed in act”).

You’ll find a sense of the word that is somehow more evocative than  any you’ve seen. “2. To convey as by a flash… as, to flash a message  along the wires; to flash conviction on the mind.” In the juxtaposition  of those two examples — a message transmitted by wires; a feeling that  comes suddenly to mind — is a beautiful analogy, worth dwelling on, and  savoring. Listen to that phrase: “to flash conviction on the mind.” This is in a *dictionary*, for God’s sake.

And, toward the bottom of the entry, as McPhee promised, is a usage  note, explaining the fine differences in meaning between words in the  penumbra of “flash”:

> … Flashing differs from exploding or disploding in not being  accompanied with a loud report. To glisten, or glister, is to shine with a soft and fitful luster, as eyes suffused with tears, or flowers wet  with dew.

Did you see that last clause? “To shine with a soft and fitful  luster, as eyes suffused with tears, or flowers wet with dew.” I’m not  sure why you won’t find writing like that in dictionaries these days,  but you won’t. Here is the modern equivalent of that sentence in the  latest edition of the Merriam-Webster: “glisten applies to the soft  sparkle from a wet or oily surface <glistening wet sidewalk>.”

Who decided that the American public couldn’t handle “a soft and  fitful luster”? I can’t help but think something has been lost. “A soft  sparkle from a wet or oily surface” doesn’t just sound worse, it  actually describes the phenomenon with less precision. In particular it  misses the shimmeriness, the micro movement and action, “the *fitful* luster,” of, for example, an eye full of tears — which is by the way  far more intense and interesting an image than “a wet sidewalk.”

It’s as if someone decided that dictionaries these days had to sound  like they were written by a Xerox machine, not a person, certainly not a person with a poet’s ear, a man capable of high and mighty English, who set out to write the secular American equivalent of the King James  Bible and pulled it off.

### Words worth using

I don’t want you to conclude that it’s just a matter of aesthetics.  Yes, Webster’s definitions are prettier. But they are also better. In  fact they’re so much better that to use another dictionary is to keep  yourself forever at arm’s length from the actual language.

Recall that the New Oxford, for the word “fustian,” gives “pompous or pretentious speech or writing.” I said earlier that that wasn’t even  really correct. Here, then, is Webster’s definition: “An inflated style  of writing; a kind of writing in which high-sounding words are used,  above the dignity of the thoughts or subject; bombast.” Do you see the  difference? What makes fustian fustian is not just that the language is  pompous — it’s that this pomposity is *above the dignity of the thoughts or subject*. It’s using fancy language where fancy language isn’t called for.

It’s a subtle difference, but that’s the whole point: English is an  awfully subtle instrument. A dictionary that ignores these little shades is dangerous; in fact in those cases it’s worse than useless. It’s  misleading, deflating. It divests those words of their worth and  purpose.

Take “pathos.” This is one of those words I used to keep looking up  because I kept forgetting what it meant — and every time I’d go to the  dictionary I would get this terse, limiting definition: “a quality that  evokes pity or sadness.” Not much there to grab a hold of. I’d wonder,  Is that really all there is to pathos? It had always seemed a grander  word than that. But this was the dictionary, and whatever it declared  was final.

Final, that is, until I discovered Webster:

**pathos** /ˈpāˌTHäs/, n. *1. The quality or  character of those emotions, traits, or experiences which are personal,  and therefore restricted and evanescent; transitory and idiosyncratic  dispositions or feelings as distinguished from those which are universal and deep-seated in character; — opposed to **ethos**.*

It continued. *2. That quality or property of anything which  touches the feelings or excites emotions and passions, esp., that which  awakens tender emotions, such as pity, sorrow, and the like; contagious  warmth of feeling, action, or expression; pathetic quality; as, the  pathos of a picture, of a poem, or of a cry.*

Dear god! How did I not know about this dictionary? How could you even *call* yourself a dictionary if all you give for “pathos” is “a quality that  evokes pity or sadness”? Webster’s definition is so much fuller, so much closer to felt experience.

Notice, too, how much less certain the Webster definition seems about itself, even though it’s more complete — as if to remind you that the  word came first, that the word isn’t *defined* by its definition  here, in this humble dictionary, that definitions grasp, tentatively, at words, but that what words really are is this haze and halo of  associations and evocations, a little networked cloud of uses and  contexts.

What I mean is that with its blunt authority the New Oxford  definition of “pathos” — “a quality that evokes pity or sadness” — shuts down the conversation, it shuts down your thinking about the word,  while the Webster’s version gets your wheels turning: it seems so much  more provisional — “that which awakens tender emotions, such as pity,  sorrow, and the like; contagious warmth of feeling, action, or  expression; pathetic quality; as, the pathos of a picture, of a poem, or of a cry” — and therefore alive.

Most important, it describes a word worth using: a mere six letters  that have come to stand for something huge, for a complex meta-emotion  with mythic roots. Such is the power of actual English.

### The pleasure of finding things out

I could go on forever listing examples. I could say, “Look up *example*, *magic*, *sport*. Look up *arduous*, *huge*, *chauvinistic*, *venal*, *pell-mell*, *raiment*, *sue*, *smarting*, *stereotype*. Look up the word *word*, and *look*, and *up*. Look up every word you used today.” Indeed that’s what motivated this  post: I’d been using Webster’s dictionary for about a year; I kept  looking words up, first there, then in whatever modern dictionary was  closest to hand, and seeing this awful difference, evidence of a crime  that kept piling up in my mind, the guilt building: so many people were  getting this wrong impression about words, every day, so many times a  day.

There’s an amazing thing that happens when you start using the right  dictionary. Knowing that it’s there for you, you start looking up more  words, including words you already know. And you develop an affection  for even those, the plainest most everyday words, because you see them  treated with the same respect awarded to the rare ones, the  high-sounding ones.

Which is to say you get a feeling about English that Calvin once got  with his pet tiger on a day of fresh-fallen snow: “It’s a magical world, Hobbes. Let’s go exploring!”

### Appendix: How to start using Webster’s 1913 dictionary on your Mac, iPhone, Android, and Kindle

The closest thing you can get to a plain-text, easily hackable, free, out-of-copyright version of the dictionary McPhee probably used is [Webster’s Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913 + 1828)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160108161120/http://machaut.uchicago.edu:80/websters).

You’ll never use it, though, unless it’s built in to your computer  and available easily on your phone and e-reader. For instance I wanted  it so that whenever I typed a word into Spotlight, I’d get a Webster’s  definition:

[![spotlight](http://jsomers.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/first.png)](http://jsomers.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/first.png)

I even wanted it so that when I highlighted a word in my browser, and hit Cmd + Ctrl + D, I’d see a definition from Webster’s:

[![inline](http://jsomers.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/second.png)](http://jsomers.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/second.png)

Here’s how I got that to work:

- Download [this archive from S3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jsomers/dictionary.zip).
- Unzip it and launch the DictUnifier app.
- Drag the `stardict-dictd-web1913-2.4.2.tar.bz2` file,  still compressed, onto that app’s little drag-and-drop area. It might  take a few seconds before the conversion process starts. Once it does,  it’ll take about 30 minutes to finish.
- The dictionary will now be available in your Dictionary app. (If  not, you may need to enable it in the app’s Preferences pane, as [here](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21294/3085216/6b3463ae-e50b-11e3-822d-a59765748865.png).) But its formatting may look a little off. If the lines are squished together, open  `~/Library/Dictionaries/dictd_www.dict.org_web1913.dictionary/Contents/DefaultStyle.css` in a text editor and add the following directive:

```
p { line-height: 0.7em }
```

Restart the Dictionary app to confirm that the CSS was updated correctly. (You might also try bumping the `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` values in the `div.y` block to 0.7em, from 0.5em. And some folks have said that 1em works better than 0.7em.)

- If you want to always see Webster’s results by default, go to the  Dictionary app’s preferences and drag Webster’s to the top of the list.
- If you’re on OS X Lion, follow [these instructions](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/22897/how-to-place-dictionary-definitions-higher-up-in-spotlight-results) so that Dictionary results appear first in Spotlight searches.
- If you’re unhappy with the formatting of the entries in Dictionary, [here](https://github.com/aparks517/convert-websters) are alternative instructions for setting up Webster’s on OS X that may give better results. ([Here](https://github.com/DieBuche/WebsterParser), too.)
- To get it on your iPhone, get the Stardict-compatible [Dictionary](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dictionary-universal/id312088272?mt=8) app. On its installation screen, go to the “Network” tab and type `https://emw3.com/stardict-dictd-web1913-2.4.2.tar.bz2`, exactly, into the URL bar. (Alternatively, just download [this free app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id943993346) by Aaron Parks.)
- For Android, you can follow [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/jsomers/9dd78c8dc7fab071993c), courtesy of [@TheRealPlato](https://twitter.com/TheRealPlato).
- To add the dictionary as a search engine on Chrome, follow [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/jsomers/60159ee970d6dee86aa2), courtesy of [@chancelionheart](https://twitter.com/chancelionheart).
- And finally, [follow these instructions](https://gist.github.com/jsomers/4236a2770a51e0b24900) to get the dictionary on your Kindle.

### Notes

[1] Note that the modern Merriam-Webster, even though it does derive  directly from Webster’s original, has been revised so much that it’s  actually *less* similar, content-wise, than some of the impostors. It, too, is one of the “wrong” dictionaries.
