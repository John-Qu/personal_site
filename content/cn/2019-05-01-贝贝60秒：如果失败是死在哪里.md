如果这个项目失败了，会是什么原因呢？

要死还不容易，比如说我中了采票，或者发现没人需要它，或者利乐控告我企图对他们的机构作逆向工程。当然这是开玩笑的。

严肃地说，我发觉有三个大风险，会导致这个项目失败。

第一，问题太难，超过我的技术能力范围。程序不通，数学不懂，这不是中人如我能插手的问题。

第二，用时太长，超过我的家庭供养容量。游荡日久，收入全无，这不是有家的人可玩味的问题。

第三，攻坚太烦，超过我的保持注意定力。眼热机会，垂涎技术，这不是多变狐狸该死嗑的问题。

目前来看，三个风险中，第三个的可能性最大。

**If this project failed finally, what were the reasons?**

There are many reasons to end this project, such as I won a lottery, or I  found nobody needs it, or Tetra Pak sued me for trying to  reverse-engineer their mechanism. That's just joking. Seriously  speaking, I see three significant risks that cause this project to fail.

First, it is too hard for my ability to solve this problem technically because I lack the knowledge of mathematics and programming.

Second, it is too long a time for my family to let me swimming on this problem  without any incomes. I need to sell my time for other profitable  projects.

Third, it is too dull for my spirit to focus on this issue, and I turn to  other impressive technology and try to fetch other chances, leaving this problem with an open ending.

Among those three significant risks, the third one has the highest possibility.
