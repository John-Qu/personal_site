Hi Brad,

I hope you haven't noticed my former mail, because I want to draw it back.

After working a whole on one email, I told my wife what I have done with some proudness. However, she asked me one key question: "Have he asked you about your opinion? Have you asked him if he wants that?" She is right: giving feedback is always a hard conversation. We haven't met each other yet, and we are not such closed friends with so much trust. Although I know it is hard to do, would you please forget about that email? 

I translated those "advise" to you because I have them in the translator's postscript. I write those contents there, I confess, because I want to show off to the Chinese readers that the translator is smarter than the author.

I am sorry for that. I deleted those "advise" content from postscript and committed it to FFI's repo minutes ago. If you merge the zh-cn branch, you can get a manifest file.

I hope you are not so angry about this issue. Keeping calm and positive might have an advantage in fighting with the virus.

Best regards.
John Qu
