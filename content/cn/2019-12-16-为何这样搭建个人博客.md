## 假设谁在读

本文的读者参考了《如何搭建静态个人博客》一篇，然而不满足于知道怎么做，还想了解为什么这样选。更重要的是，他不喜欢原文作者的品味，在几个岔路口想要作出自己的选择。这里指出分支路口的位置，并简单罗列各条路上的风景，同时解释作者为什么选择了那一条路。

## 务虚的问题

### 为什么要建个人博客

我网故我在。

>   In the summer of 2012, I did my internship at AT&T Labs Research,[1](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/#fn1) where I attended a talk given by Carlos Scheidegger (https://cscheid.net), and Carlos said something along the lines of “if you don’t have a  website nowadays, you don’t exist.” Later I paraphrased it as:
>
>   >   “I web, therefore I am ~~a spiderman~~.”
>
>   Carlos’s words resonated very well with me, although they were a  little exaggerated. A well-designed and maintained website can be  extremely helpful for other people to know you, and you do not need to  wait for suitable chances at conferences or other occasions to introduce yourself in person to other people. On the other hand, a website is  also highly useful for yourself to keep track of what you have done and  thought. Sometimes you may go back to a certain old post of yours to  relearn the tricks or methods you once mastered in the past but have  forgotten.

成本低。

收益久。

自己作主。

## 实务的问题

### 为什么用 163 邮箱

年代久，用户多。

有收费产品。

QQ 邮箱会被屏蔽。

Gmail 邮箱网页版不能用，通过某些客户端可以用，我用的网易邮箱大师就行。
