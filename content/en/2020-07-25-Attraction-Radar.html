<h4>The function of Jaw System</h4>
<p>I had seen the working process of jaws on Tetra Pak&#39;s <a href='http://tma1992.com/en/product/filling-line-for-fruit-puree-and-juices-tetra-pak-tba-19/'>TBA 19</a> and <a href='https://www.equipmatching.com/used_equipment/12/146/300335.php'>TBA 22</a> filling machines when I was in the <a href='https://meticulousblog.org/top-10-companies-in-dairy-processing-equipment-market/'>dairy equipment</a> business. I see its general purpose, but I don&#39;t know the detailed functional time sequence in two collaborating circles of left-hand and right-hand jaws. I am studying the servo motor function in the drive unit of Tetra Pak&#39;s <a href='https://www.tetrapak.com/packaging/tetra-pak-a3-compactflex'>A3/Flex</a> filling machine. So I must clarify what task is performing in each stage as accurate as in machine degree. I noticed an acceleration chart on <a href='https://www.mscsoftware.com/sites/default/files/metodi-strumenti-calcolo-prototipaz.pdf'>a report slide</a> from Tetra Pak. It tells me some information about what it does by comparing it with video from youtube. It shows what is the relation of the left-hand jaw and right-hand jaw by <a href='https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dcf37a147ddd9b73fcbd55e10478a3462b632a68/68747470733a2f2f747661312e73696e61696d672e636e2f6c617267652f303036744e6252776c793167396a686d74793472686a3331316930753037776a2e6a7067'>comparing</a> it with itself of moving 180 degrees aside. I have measured that chart with LibreCAD and regenerated the <a href='https://camo.githubusercontent.com/69498dcaf1f297bafe57542fae8a6ae77a2af6a3/68747470733a2f2f747661312e73696e61696d672e636e2f6c617267652f303036744e6252776c793167396a693176673938646a333163313075306231362e6a7067'>curve</a> with SymPy. But I don&#39;t think I have understood enough about the functions until my cam profile runs on a real <a href='https://www.tetrapak.com/packaging/tetra-pak-a3-compactflex'>A3/Flex</a> filing machine smoothly. I will try to find and catch opportunities in industry <a href='http://www.leiwest.com/productsshow.asp?id=248'>here</a> and <a href='http://gspak.com.cn/ProductInfo_13_4.aspx'>there</a>.</p>
<h4>SymPy for Kinematics</h4>
<p>I deduced equations in the kinematics of mechanism in Tetra Pak&#39;s <a href='https://www.tetrapak.com/packaging/tetra-pak-a3-compactflex'>A3/Flex</a> filling machine with SymPy. I didn&#39;t dive into SymPy, only using it as a calculator with a script. I wonder whether there is a similar <a href='http://mth229.github.io/symbolic.html'>symbolic calculation in Julia</a>, and it seems the <a href='https://discourse.julialang.org/t/sympy-jl-vs-symengine-jl-vs-reduce-jl-vs/10381'>answer</a> is &#39;yes.&#39; I will try some switching work when I finished the first round of refactoring.</p>
<h3>Engage</h3>
<h4>Vector Method in Kinematics</h4>
<p>I have an analysis problem of rocker-slider four-bar mechanism in the Tetra Pak <a href='https://www.tetrapak.com/packaging/tetra-pak-a3-compactflex'>A3/Flex</a> filling machine. I need to know the end position, velocity, and acceleration according to the driving slider and vice verse. In the hacking process of <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a>, I read chapters in the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Machines-Mechanisms-John-Uicker/dp/0190658908'>Theory of Machines and Mechanisms (5th)</a>. At that time, I took notes on white paper and made notations on it. I would like to write documentation for this project, so I need to make professional drawings and notations.</p>
<h4>TDD with CAE application</h4>
<p>Adding tests is a must-have step in refactoring. The code in <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a> is numerical computing, not UI, package, or App. On how to write unit tests for this kind of system, I need some examples. On the reading radar of thoughtworkers, books about testing are: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/1239651/'>单元测试之道Java版</a> (pdf of en, and cn at library)</li>
<li><a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/25742200/'>Google软件测试之道</a> (cn bought), </li>

<li><a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/25735501/'>测试驱动开发</a> (cn at library). </li>

</ul>
<p>I have read the first half of <em><a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/26640135/'>Test-driven development with Python</a></em> on <a href='https://www.ituring.com.cn/book/2052'>iTuring.com</a> and Harry Percival&#39;s <a href='https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/'><em>Obey the Testing Goat</em> website</a>.</p>
<h4>Grammar for Documentation</h4>
<p>Writing in a simple sentence with simple words is good. However, too simple is not. <a href='https://app.grammarly.com/'>Grammarly.app</a> can tell me what is no good, but I have to write out my own ideas. I have scanned <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style'>The Elements of Style</a>, <a href='https://www.cambridge.org/us/cambridgeenglish/catalog/grammar-vocabulary-and-pronunciation/english-grammar-use-5th-edition'>English Grammar In Use</a>. I am learning <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Collins-COBUILD-English-Grammar-UK/dp/0008135819'>Collins COBUILD English Grammar</a>. I had better read Steven Pinker&#39;s <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sense_of_Style'>The Sense of Style</a> first.</p>
<h3>Concern</h3>
<h4>Refactor of <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a></h4>
<p>Last year in the <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a> project, I have hacked the motion math functions of the Tetra Pak <a href='https://www.tetrapak.com/packaging/tetra-pak-a3-compactflex'>A3/Flex</a> filling machine&#39;s driving servo motor. Only I know the order of running sequence to get the proper result curve. Although <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a> is released from initial, it fails in meeting the release guidelines such as that in Zalando&#39;s &quot;<a href='https://opensource.zalando.com/blog/2019/05/How-We-Release-Code/'>How we release open source projects</a>.&quot; I don&#39;t know whether someone else might be interested in this project. I noticed yesterday that there is <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon/stargazers'>one star in this project</a>, which comes from <a href='https://github.com/luzpaz'>luzpaz</a>, a <a href='https://forum.freecadweb.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12229'>veteran</a> on the FreeCAD forum. I thrived on doing it right, and now I am trying to do it well, to make it alive and longlived. So I need to arrange the hashing code, with professional know-how from <a href='https://martinfowler.com/'>Martin Fowler</a>&#39;s book <em><a href='https://refactoring.com/'>Refactor</a></em>. I borrowed the <a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/30468597/'>second edition&#39;s Chinese version</a> from the library, then bought one on kongfz.com. It is translated by <a href='https://www.thoughtworks.com/cn/profiles/xiong-jie'>Jeff Xiong</a>, a former thoughtworker who had <a href='http://gigix.thoughtworkers.org/'>blogged</a> twelve years weekly. The English version is available on <a href='https://martinfowler.com/articles/access-refactoring-web-edition.html'>InformIT.com</a>.</p>
<h4>Javascript Tutorial</h4>
<p>I didn&#39;t learn Javascript when I studied in the course on <a href='https://xiaochu.ga/Content/fullstack.xinshengdaxue.com.html'>full-stack technology with Ruby on Rails in Spring 2017</a>. I knew it is widely used in web applications, but I don&#39;t need that. Now I am eager to read <a href='https://martinfowler.com/'>Martin Fowler</a>&#39;s book <em><a href='https://refactoring.com/'>Refactor</a></em>, which takes Javascript code as examples. I need to know the basics in Javascript, but not need to dig into the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742'>subtleties in it</a>, as it has so many platforms, such as jQuery, Node.js, and Vue.js. I found that Prof. <a href='http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/'>Daniel Jackson at MIT</a> gave short <a href='http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/teaching/6170/javascript-live/'>introduction pages on JavaScript</a>, which is <a href='http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/teaching/6170/javascript-16/'>up to date</a>, and W3C has interactive <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp'>tutorials on JavaScript</a>.</p>
<h4>Economics in OSS</h4>
<p>I am doing engineering work on mechanical analysis and software tools. The result is mine, but the effect is ours if it can trigger more work of others. I acknowledged <a href='http://www.catb.org/~esr/who-is-ESR.html'>ESR</a>&#39;s <a href='http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/'>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</a>. I used it to argue with Brad on releasing the <a href='https://bookdown.org/johnqu1982/FFI/'>FFI in Chinese</a> for public reading. I am running at making <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a> truly usable on Github, so I need to consider the reactions among users. I would read the <a href='https://opensource.guide/'>open-source guide</a> created by Github, and participate in Xia Qingfeng&#39;s <em><a href='https://github.com/qingfengxia/FreeCAD_Mod_Dev_Guide'>Module developer&#39;s guide to FreeCAD source code</a></em>, Realthunder&#39;s <a href='https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3'>FreeCAD Assembly3</a>, and one <a href='https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons'>add-on of FreeCAD</a>.</p>
<h4>ThoughtWorks Insight</h4>
<p>I like the tone in the insight blogs of <a href='https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights'>thoughtworkers</a>. They have real projects from customers, and they have the mechanism and ability to write lessons from experience. The <a href='https://insights.thoughtworks.cn/'>ThoughtWorkers&#39; Insight</a> has catalogs and tags, so I could search by topic or author. I wish I could grow to look similar to them, such as the <a href='https://insights.thoughtworks.cn/author/xiongjie/'>Insights of Jeff Xiong</a></p>
<h3>Hold</h3>
<h4>Abstraction and Specification for <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a></h4>
<p>I read <a href='http://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/'>Prof. Guttag</a>&#39;s <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computation-Programming-Using-Python/dp/0262529629'>Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python</a> in 2008. I am rereading it recently in preparing to rewrite the code in <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a>. I noticed that Mr. Guttag has coauthored another book called <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Program-Development-Java-Specification-Object-Oriented/dp/0201657686'>Program Development in Java - Abstraction, Specification, and Object-Oriented Design</a>. This book is classic, and <a href='https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-170-laboratory-in-software-engineering-fall-2005/readings/'>said</a> to be &quot;parallels the course material closely; it&#39;s a good book for background reading.&quot; in the <a href='https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-170-laboratory-in-software-engineering-fall-2005/'>MIT-OCW course &quot;Laboratory in Software Engineering&quot; in 2005</a>. I want to learn the best practices in software engineer, and I could learn Java along with the reading of this book. I borrowed <a href='https://library.sh.cn/#/index/pBookDetails?bid=5422467&amp;type=zbook'>one book on Java</a> from the library and downloaded several books. However, no one asks for my specification now, and the data abstraction seems not so complicated in b-splines. In short, I need not care too much about the topic of specification, requirements, and abstraction, which are common in software engineering. Best practices achieve more effects in practice. I&#39;d better leave it until I joined a team and learn from neighbor engineers. By the way, Prof. Guttag didn&#39;t mention this book in his <a href='https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/readings/'>new course</a>, neither in thoughtworkers in their three versions (<a href='http://agiledon.github.io/blog/2013/04/17/thoughtworks-developer-reading-radar/'>2013</a>、<a href='https://insights.thoughtworks.cn/reading-radar-2016/'>2016</a>、<a href='https://insights.thoughtworks.cn/reading-radar-2019/'>2019</a>) of <a href='https://insights.thoughtworks.cn/reading-radar-2019/'>Reading Radar</a>.</p>

<h4>Julia for <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a></h4>
<p>When I search &quot;<a href='https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/numerical-methods-in-engineering-with-python-3/95151C37C2F427F30DC90FA619FE79F9'>Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3</a>&quot; within site of ocw.mit.edu, I found that MIT is teaching a <a href='https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-335j-introduction-to-numerical-methods-spring-2019/'>Introduction to Numerical Methods</a> course with a new language called <a href='http://julialang.org/'>Julia</a>. It is <a href='https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-335j-introduction-to-numerical-methods-spring-2019/week-1/Julia-intro.pdf'>faster than Python</a> on a large scale of data. My code runs about 20 minutes in some functions. I need to take one eye on it and see if there is a chance to switch to Julia, to change <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a> to TetraCamLia.</p>
<h4>Onshape Features</h4>
<p> is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onshape'>first CAD tool initially in SAAS</a>. I would like to work with them, but they <a href='https://careers.ptc.com/TGnewUI/Search/home/HomeWithPreLoad?partnerid=2&amp;siteid=5213&amp;PageType=searchResults&amp;SearchType=linkquery&amp;LinkID=4393247#keyWordSearch=&amp;locationSearch='>don&#39;t have a business in China</a> mainland. When they come, I wish I have been prepared. I will take a tour on the onshape <a href='https://forum.onshape.com/#_ga=2.131834828.218102043.1595989237-1957610019.1593917704'>forum</a> and <a href='https://www.onshape.com/cad-blog'>blogs</a> weekly and see if my classmate could help me join their <a href='https://www.onshape.com/education-plan'>Education Standard Plan</a>. </p>

<h4>Teach Tech to Adults</h4>
<p>Although I don&#39;t have anything to teach now, I am doing something interesting to show former me. The purpose of doing these <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a> project series is for teaching. Teaching technology is not an easy task that can do naturally. <a href='http://third-bit.com/'>Greg Wilson</a>, a coach in Rstudio, wrote a series of articles on <a href='https://teachtogether.tech/'>Teaching Tech Together</a>.</p>
<h4>FreeCAD Development</h4>
<p>I like the discussion in the <a href='https://forum.freecadweb.org/'>forum of FreeCAD</a>, and I am in the <a href='https://github.com/FreeCAD'>Github</a> mail list of developers. I would like to build an add-on of cam profile design for FreeCAD later. So I need to keep up with the development of FreeCAD. I will surf through the forum weekly, and read through then translate Xia Qingfeng&#39;s <em><a href='https://github.com/qingfengxia/FreeCAD_Mod_Dev_Guide'>Module developer&#39;s guide to FreeCAD source code</a></em>.</p>
<h4>FreeCAD Usage</h4>
<p>I start modeling with FreeCAD when I was translating <a href='https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?t=30959'>FreeCAD For Inventors</a>. If I really commit that FreeCAD has a future in being a platform for open mechanisms, I had better put in enough effort to show its certainty. There were <a href='https://bookauthority.org/books/new-freecad-ebooks'>no good enough tutorials</a> and books on FreeCAD now. Still, there are some <a href='https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=freeCAD'>videos</a> on youtube, developed by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRGXbDM8raKr6t-4xhJDKJw'>developers</a>.</p>
<h4>Computation on Data</h4>
<p>I have reviewed  <a href='http://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/'>Prof. Guttag</a>&#39;s <em><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computation-Programming-Using-Python/dp/0262529629'>Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python</a></em> the first half, until Chapter 12. In the second half, Prof. Guttag talked about computation on data applications. Now I have no subject on data, so I had better put this book down for a while. When I am facing mass data, I will come back. Alternatively, I would like to learn along with my wife.</p>

<h3>Occupy</h3>
<h4>Being a Photographer</h4>
<p>I like taking photos, but my picture is not touching for the general audience. I read a brochure <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Being-Photographer-Practical-Guide/dp/1888803061'>On Being a Photographer</a> the last winter before taking pictures of my sister-in-law&#39;s wedding party. Now I don&#39;t have a long term subject, like those I had in the past, such as running people, wedding ceremonies, and playing children.</p>
<h4>Convict Conditioning</h4>
<p>I couldn&#39;t left my arm to wash my face for two month in the summer of 2014 after I blowed myself on a bridge after running one night and blowed under an air conditioner the next morning. I have begun to practice convict conditioning since then. Now I can do </p>
<ul>
<li>2 sets of 15 close pushups, </li>
<li>2 sets of 10 (both sides) one-leg squats, </li>
<li>2 sets of 5 (both sides) close pullups, </li>
<li>2 sets of 10 hanging straight leg raises, </li>
<li>2 sets of 8 full bridges, and </li>
<li>1 set of 5 half handstand pushups. </li>

</ul>
<p>I have the book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Convict-Conditioning-Weakness-Using-Survival-Strength/dp/0938045768'>Convict Conditioning</a>, and I had better progress step by step.</p>
<h3>Engage</h3>
<h4>Road Run in Summer</h4>
<p>I recently have the proper training conditions, and I want to make this process a &quot;strong track record of success.&quot; I use a training diagram that I prepared for the 2018 Shanghai marathon, but I found it hard to complete because of the hot weather. I need to figure out a new diagram which is suitable for summer. I am going to read through <a href='http://www.librarything.com/work/15248645/reviews/119802147'>Pete Pfitzinger&#39;s book <em>Faster road racing</em></a>.</p>
<h3>Concern</h3>
<h4>Sense in Numbers</h4>
<p>Dr. Wu Jun gives <a href='https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nQNB3iVxcRZvri0IY6PuIw'>a Math course on Gotit.app</a>, similar to Oxford&#39;s Very Short Introductions series. My elder child is approaching his six, and he is studying math apps on the iPad. I wish I could talk with him about the joy and concept in numbers, not just answering his questions. I would do DuckDuckMoose with him and read <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/series/164944-crowell-young-math-books'>Young Math Books</a> beforehand.</p>
<h2>Meanings</h2>
<h3>Occupy</h3>
<h4>Migration in Breath</h4>
<p>I found it hard to surf in waves of the mind, even that I cannot work and study continuously and effectively in the last winter. So I made a decision that I must learn to be able to live with that wave. I borrowed Swami Lama&#39;s <em><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Meditation-Its-Practice-Swami-Rama/dp/0893891533'>Meditation and Its Practice</a></em> from the library, and practice according to its guidance while residual in Wuhan in this spring 2020. </p>
<h3>Concern</h3>
<h4>Live my Life out</h4>
<p>I have listened to <a href='https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/8v7MSUUZ2yKYnuQX40VyiQ'>Wu Zhihong&#39;s psychology course on Gotit.app</a> for two or three rounds. Maybe psychoanalysis is not a scientific approach, but it touched my soul and triggered my change. I am living out my own life with the power of action, like when I am a little drunk. Whenever I read paragraphs in <a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/30408662/'>his book</a>, I can find some strength.</p>
<h3>Hold</h3>
<h4>The Analects of Confucius</h4>
<p>Last year I took the course <a href='https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/wL6SNTcjxJQWmbKTse5WIQ'>Brand marketing of Mr. Hua Shan</a> on Gotit.app. I enjoyed it in reading his book <em><a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/26913479/'>Hua Shan Explains The Analects of Confucius Completely</a></em> that I borrowed from the library. It tells some reasonings in everyday life in the Chinese culture, which I found to be my basis of feelings when contact with people. I had started to read Prof. Qian Mu&#39;s <a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/6775830/'>New Explanation of The Analects of Confucius</a> in 2017. But abandoned it with a new task because it is a luxury to read this kind of book as an adult without a job. Now, I have other issues to deal with, so I will hold on to these wishes until I found a job earning money.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<h3>Occupy</h3>
<h4>Attraction Radar</h4>
<p>This is what I adopted after engagement with <a href='https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar'>ThoughtWorks&#39;s Technology Radar</a>. I think it might become a <a href='../cn/2020/07/mechanics-on-attraction-radar/'>proper tool</a> for me to manage my attention. As I will respect my attraction radar, I have read through their Technology Radar and keep an eye on it in the future.</p>
<h3>Engage</h3>
<h4>Personal OKRs</h4>
<p>OKRs are practical tools for active workers besides KPIs in an organization full of intelligence. I am not in a particular firm, but I want to place myself in the community of open-source CAD software. I need to navigate my story finding the HOW and WHAT from WHY, and need to separate it into objectives and define the SMART vital results. I have seen <a href='https://www.ted.com/talks/john_doerr_why_the_secret_to_success_is_setting_the_right_goals/transcript'>John Doerr&#39;s TED talk on OKRs</a> in <a href='https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rnYHBCZy6HeEH-QVS3MWqg'>Mr. Yu&#39;s article about OKRs</a>, and I am reading his book: <a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/30396635/'><em>Measure What Matters - How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs</em></a>.</p>
<h3>Concern</h3>
<h4>Structures in Mathematics</h4>
<p>If I want to learn the logical part, I need to spend most of my time deducing and solving problems. I have spent half of my study time reading mathematics. I recently heard from Dr. Wu Jun that there are clues in math that act as the bridge between its nature and usages, which doesn&#39;t need so much time to learn so much concrete points of knowledge. I had better understand Dr. Wu&#39;s <a href='https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/nQNB3iVxcRZvri0IY6PuIw'>course</a> throughout.</p>
<h4>Science in Learning</h4>
<p>I am entering a new era of engineering software. I need to learn a lot of topics efficiently and effectively. Wan Weigang had gathered his articles about learning science into a book called <a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/35082292/'><em>What is Learning in the End</em></a>. He has posted a series of articles reporting his new earnings in reading <a href='https://book.douban.com/subject/35013354/'>How We Learn: Why Brains Learn Better Than Any Machine... for now</a>. I found some advice valuable about being a pragmatic programmer in the reading radar of thoughtworkers. </p>
<h3>Hold</h3>
<h4>Reading Tech Documents</h4>
<p>In <a href='https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JkfgFfZnKlvWyg3oSxzzdA'>Dr. Wu Jun&#39;s course, Reading and Writing</a>, he proposed reading steps when entering a professional field: 1) Orthodox literature, 2) authoritative reviews and 3) academic monographs. I had better read and learn with such frameworks, rather than by instinct. There are several books recommended in the reading radars of ThoughtWorkers:</p>

<h4>Open Source Releasing</h4>
<p>I release <a href='https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon'>TetraCamThon</a> with a ReadMe, but I don&#39;t know what to include in it. I just looked at what other repositories do. Still, there should have been some code of conduct in releasing an open-source project for public users and contributors, such as Zalando&#39;s &quot;<a href='https://opensource.zalando.com/blog/2019/05/How-We-Release-Code/'>How we release open source projects</a>.&quot;</p>
<h4>HTML Slide</h4>
<p>I like the slides in HTML, such as <a href='http://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/zh-CN.html'>Xie Yihui&#39;s xaringan introduction</a> and Prof. <a href='http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/'>Daniel Jackson</a>&#39;s <a href='http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/teaching/6170/javascript-live/modules/basics/slides.html#/'>JavaScript Overview</a>. Xie said it is easy to construct this kind of <a href='https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html'>slides from Rmarkdown</a>. If I can figure out how to do it in half an hour, I would like to adopt it. Maybe I will try it when I make presentation the next time.</p>
