### What is testing and debugging?

Testing is the process of running a program to try and ascertain whether or not it works as intended. Debugging is the process of trying to fix a program that you already know does not work as intended.

### How to design problems in ways that make them easier to test and debug?

The key to doing this is breaking the program up into separate components that can be implemented, tested, and debugged independently of other components.

## 6.1 Testing

### What is the most important thing to say about testing?

The most important thing to say about testing is that its purpose is to show that bugs exist, not to show that a program is bug-free. To quote Edsger Dijkstra, “Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!”39 Or, as Albert Einstein reputedly said, “No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.”

### What is the key to testing?

The key to testing is finding a collection of inputs, called a **test suite**, that has a high likelihood of revealing bugs, yet does not take too long to run. The key to doing this is **partitioning** the space of all possible inputs into subsets that provide equivalent information about the correctness of the program, and then constructing a test suite that contains at least one input from each partition. (Usually, constructing such a test suite is not actually possible. Think of this as an unachievable ideal.) 

### How to partition the set of possible inputs?

A **partition** of a set divides that set into a collection of subsets such that each element of the original set belongs to exactly one of the subsets. If one tested the implementation on at least one value from each of these subsets, there would be reasonable probability (but no guarantee) of exposing a bug if one exists.

For most programs, finding a good partitioning of the inputs is far easier said than done. Typically, people rely on heuristics[^heuristics] based on exploring different paths through some combination of the code and the specifications. Heuristics based on exploring paths through the code fall into a class called **glass-box testing**. Heuristics based on exploring paths through the specification fall into a class called **black-box testing**.

[^heuristics]: heuristics: [Computing] proceeding to a solution by trial and error or by rules that are only loosely defined.

### What are the positive features of the independence of black-box testing?

1. It reduces the likelihood of generating test suites that exhibit mistakes that are correlated with mistakes in the code.
1. It is robust with respect to implementation changes.

### What boundary condition should be tested?

When looking at lists, this often means looking at the empty list, a list with exactly one element, and a list containing lists. When dealing with numbers, it typically means looking at very small and very large values as well as “typical” values.

For `sqrt`, for example, it might make sense to try values of x and epsilon similar to those in here:

|      X      |   Epsilon   |
| :---------: | :---------: |
|     0.0     |   0.0001    |
|    25.0     |   0.0001    |
|     0.5     |   0.0001    |
|     2.0     |   0.0001    |
|     2.0     | 1.0/2.0**64 |
| 1.0/2.0**64 | 1.0/2.0**64 |
|  2.0**64.0  | 1.0/2.0**64 |
| 1.0/2.0**64 |  2.0**64.0  |
|  2.0**64.0  |  2.0**64.0  |

Another important boundary condition to think about is aliasing. Consider, for example, the code

```{python}
def copy(L1, L2):
    """ Assumes L1, L2 are lists
        Mutates L2 to be a copy of L1"""
    while len(L2) > 0: #remove all elements from L2
        L2.pop() #remove last element of L2
    for e in L1: #append L1's elements to initially empty L2
        L2.append(e)
        
L = [1, 2, 3]
copy(L, L)
print(L)
```


### If any of these tests fail, something needs to be fixed. Where do those "something" lie?

Perhaps there is a bug in the code that needs to be fixed, or perhaps the specification needs to be changed so that it is easier to meet. It might, for example, be unreasonable to expect to find an approximation of a square root when epsilon is ridiculously small.

### Why it is rarely sufficient to do black-box testing?

Without looking at the internal structure of the code, it is impossible to know which test cases are likely to provide new information. Consider the trivial example:

```{python}
def isPrime(x):
    """ Assumes x is a nonnegative int
        Returns True if x is prime; False otherwise""" 
    if x <= 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, x):
        if x%i == 0: 
            return False
    return True
```

Without looking at the code, one might not test `isPrime(2)`, and would therefore not discover that the function call `isPrime(2)` returns `False`, erroneously indicating that `2` is not a prime.

### Why are glass-box test suites usually much easier to construct than black-box test suites?

Specifications are usually incomplete and often pretty sloppy, making it a challenge to estimate how thoroughly a black-box test suite explores the space of interesting inputs. In contrast, the notion[^notion] of a path through code is well defined, and it is relatively easy to evaluate how thoroughly one is exploring the space. There are, in fact, commercial tools that can be used to objectively measure the completeness of glass-box tests.

[^notion]: **notion**: Mental apprehension of whatever may be known or imagined; an idea; a conception; more properly, a general or universal conception, as distinguishable or definable by marks or *notae*.

### Can a path-complete test suite guarantee that all bugs will be exposed?

Consider:

```{python}
def abs(x):
    """Assumes x is an int
        Returns x if x>=0 and –x otherwise"""
    if x < -1:
        return -x
    else:
        return x
```

The specification suggests that there are two possible cases: `x` either is negative or it isn’t. This suggests that the set of inputs `{2, -2}` is sufficient to explore all paths in the specification. This test suite has the additional nice property of forcing the program through all of its paths, so it looks like a complete glass-box suite as well. The only problem is that this test suite will not expose the fact that `abs(-1)` will return` -1`.

### A few rules of thumb about glass-box testing

- Exercise both branches of all `if` statements.

- Make sure that each `except` clause (seeChapter7) is executed.

- For each `for` loop, have test cases in which
    - The loop is not entered (e.g., if the loop is iterating over the elements of a list, make sure that it is tested on the empty list),

    - The body of the loop is executed exactly once, and

    - The body of the loop is executed more than once.

- For each `while` loop,

    - Look at the same kinds of cases as when dealing with for loops.

    - Include test cases corresponding to all possible ways of exiting the loop.
    
      For example, for a loop starting with
    
      `while len(L) > 0 and not L[i] == e`
    
      find cases where the loop exits because `len(L)` is greater than zero and cases where it exits because `L[i] == e`.
    
- For recursive functions, include test cases that cause the function to return with no recursive calls, exactly one recursive call, and more than one recursive call.

### What are the two phases when conducting tests?

Unit testing: tests designed to ascertain whether individual units of code (e.g., functions) work properly.

Integration testing: tests designed to ascertain whether the program as a whole behaves as intended. 

In some organizations the development group is responsible for unit testing and the QA (quality assurance) group for integration testing.

### Why is integration testing always more challenging than unit testing?

One reason for this is that the intended behavior of an entire program is often considerably harder to characterize than the intended behavior of each of its parts. 

Problems of scale can also make integration testing difficult. It is not unusual for integration tests to take hours or even days to run.

### In industry, or in very large programming courses, how do testers conduct testing?

They use test drivers that autonomously

- Set up the environment needed to invoke the program (or unit) to be tested,
- Invoke the program (or unit) to be tested with a predefined or automatically generated sequence of inputs,
- Save the results of these invocations,
- Check the acceptability of the results of the tests, and
- Prepare an appropriate report.

### What is stubs in unit testing?

During unit testing, we often need to build stubs as well as drivers. Drivers simulate parts of the program that use the unit being tested, whereas stubs simulate parts of the program used by the unit being tested. Stubs are useful because they allow people to test units that depend upon software or sometimes even hardware that does not yet exist. This allows teams of programmers to simultaneously develop and test multiple parts of a system.

Ideally, a stub should

- Check the reasonableness of the environment and arguments supplied by the caller (calling a function with inappropriate arguments is a common error),
- Modify arguments and global variables in a manner consistent with the specification, and
- Return values consistent with the specification.

### Why is building adequate stubs often a challenge?

If the unit the stub is replacing is intended to perform some complex task, building a stub that performs actions consistent with the specification may be tantamount to writing the program that the stub is designed to replace. One way to surmount this problem is to limit the set of arguments accepted by the stub, and create a table that contains the values to be returned for each combination of arguments to be used in the test suite.

## 6.2 Debugging

### Is "bug" a moth[^moth] found 1947 in the Mark II Calculator at Harvard University?

![image-20200528103954119](/images/2020-05-27-06-TESTING-AND-DEBUGGING//image-20200528103954119.png)

[^moth]: **moth**: 1 insect like a butterfly but less brightly coloured, flying mainly at night and attracted to bright lights . 2 (also clothes moth) small similar insect that breeds in cloth, fur, etc, its young feeding on the cloth and making holes in it.

Some have claimed that the discovery of that unfortunate moth trapped in the Mark II led to the use of the phrase debugging. However the wording, “First actual case of a bug being found,” suggests that a less literal interpretation of the phrase was already common. 

Grace Murray Hopper, a leader of the Mark II project, made it clear that the term “bug” was already in wide use to describe problems with electronic systems during World War II. 

And well prior to that, Hawkins’ New Catechism of Electricity, an 1896 electrical handbook, included the entry, “The term ‘bug’ is used to a limited extent to designate any fault or trouble in the connections or working of electric apparatus.” 

In English usage the word “bugbear” means “anything causing seemingly needless or excessive fear or anxiety.” Shakespeare seems to have shortened this to “bug,” when he had Hamlet kvetch about “bugs and goblins in my life.”

### What is the negative effect of using "bug" to describe problems in programs?

The use of the word “bug” sometimes leads people to ignore the fundamental fact that if you wrote a program and it has a “bug,” you messed up. 

1. Bugs do not crawl unbidden into flawless programs. If your program has a bug, it is because you put it there. 
1. Bugs do not breed in programs. If your program has multiple bugs, it is because you made multiple mistakes.

### In what dimensions can runtime bugs be categorized?

Overt → covert: An overt[^overt] bug has an obvious manifestation[^manifest], e.g., the program crashes or takes far longer (maybe forever) to run than it should. A covert[^covert] bug has no obvious manifestation. The program may run to conclusion with no problem—other than providing an incorrect answer. Many bugs fall between the two extremes, and whether or not the bug is overt can depend upon how carefully one examines the behavior 【by testing?】of the program.

Persistent → intermittent: A persistent[^persist] bug occurs every time the program is run with the same inputs. An intermittent[^intermittent] bug occurs only some of the time, even when the program is run on the same inputs and seemingly under the same conditions. In programs that model situations in which randomness plays a role, intermittent bugs are common.

[^overt]: **overt**: Open to view; public; apparent; manifest. Opposite of hidden.
[^covert]: **covert**: Covered over; private; hid; secret; disguised. - How covert matters may be best disclosed. - Shak. - Whether of open war or covert guile. - Milton
[^manifest]: **manifest**: [Syn.] What is *clear* can be seen readily; what is *obvious* lies directly in our way, and necessarily arrests our attention; what is *evident* is seen so clearly as to remove doubt; what is *manifest* is very distinctly evident.
[^persist]: **persist**: To stand firm; to be fixed and unmoved; to stay; to continue steadfastly; especially, to continue fixed in a course of conduct against opposing motives; to persevere; – sometimes conveying an unfavorable notion, as of doggedness or obstinacy.
[^intermittent]: **intermittent**: Coming and going at intervals; alternating; recurrent; periodic; as, an *intermittent* fever.

### What is defensive-programming?

Good programmers try to write their programs in such a way that programming mistakes lead to bugs that are both overt and persistent.

### What is the good news about debugging?

Debugging is a learned skill. Nobody does it well instinctively. The good news is that it’s not hard to learn, and it is a transferable skill. The same skills used to debug software can be used to find out what is wrong with other complex systems, e.g., laboratory experiments or sick humans.

### What’s much more important than the debugging tools?

It is how you approach the problem. Many experienced programmers don’t even bother with debugging tools. Most programmers say that the most important debugging tool is the print statement.

### What is the essence of a debugging process?

Debugging starts when testing has demonstrated that the program behaves in undesirable ways. Debugging is the process of searching for an explanation of that behavior. The key to being consistently good at debugging is being systematic in conducting that search.

### What are the key steps in conducting a debugging?

1. Start by studying the available data. This includes the test results and the program text. 

   Study *all* of the test results. Examine not only the tests that revealed the presence of a problem, but also those tests that seemed to work perfectly. Trying to understand why one test worked and another did not is often illuminating[^illuminating]. When looking at the program text, keep in mind that you don’t completely understand it. If you did, there probably wouldn’t be a bug.

1. Next, form a hypothesis[^hypothesis] that you believe to be consistent[^consistent] with all the data. 

   The hypothesis could be as narrow as “if I change line 403 from `x < y` to `x <= y`, the problem will go away” or as broad as “my program is not terminating because I have the wrong exit condition in some `while` loop.”

1. Next, design and run a repeatable experiment with the potential to *refute*[^refute] the hypothesis. 

   For example, you might put a `print` statement before and after each `while` loop. If these are always paired, then the hypothesis that a `while` loop is causing nontermination has been refuted. Decide before running the experiment how you would interpret various possible results. If you wait until after you run the experiment, you are more likely to fall prey[^prey] to wishful thinking.

1. Finally, it’s important to keep a record of what experiments you have tried. 

   When you’ve spent many hours changing your code trying to track down an elusive[^elusive] bug, it’s easy to forget what you have already tried. If you aren’t careful, it is easy to waste way too many hours trying the same experiment (or more likely an experiment that looks different but will give you the same information) over and over again. Remember, as many have said, “insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again, but expecting different results.”

[^illuminating]: **illuminating**: a. Giving or producing light; used for illumination.
[^hypothesis]: **hypothesis**: A supposition; a proposition or principle which is supposed or taken for granted, in order to draw a conclusion or inference for proof of the point in question; something not proved, but assumed for the purpose of argument, or to account for a fact or an occurrence; as, the hypothesis that head winds detain an overdue steamer. An hypothesis being a mere supposition, there are no other limits to hypotheses than those of the human imagination. J. S. Mill.
[^consistent]: **consistent**: Having agreement with itself or with something else; having harmony among its parts; possessing unity; accordant; harmonious; congruous; compatible; uniform; not contradictory.

[^refute]: **refute**: To disprove and overthrow by argument, evidence, or countervailing proof; to prove to be false or erroneous; to confute; as, to refute arguments; to refute testimony; to refute opinions or theories; to refute a disputant.
[^prey]: **prey**: Anything, as goods, etc., taken or got by violence; anything taken by force from an enemy in war; spoil; booty; plunder.
[^elusive]: **elusive**: a. Tending to elude; using arts or deception to escape; adroitly escaping or evading; eluding the grasp; fallacious.

### How to reduce the size of the search space of certain bug in a program?

Think of debugging as a search process, and each experiment as an attempt to reduce the size of the search space. One way to reduce the size of the search space is to design an experiment that can be used to decide whether a specific region of code is responsible for a problem uncovered during integration testing. Another way to reduce the search space is to reduce the amount of test data needed to provoke a manifestation of a bug.

### When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Checking list

- Look for the usual suspects. 
  	E.g., have you
  
  - Passed arguments to a function in the wrong order,
  - Misspelled a name, e.g., typed a lowercase letter when you should have typed an uppercase one,
  - Failed to reinitialize a variable,
  - Tested that two floating point values are equal (`==`) instead of nearly equal (remember that floating point arithmetic is not the same as the arithmetic you learned in school),
  - Tested for value equality (e.g., compared two lists by writing the expression `L1 == L2`) when you meant object equality (e.g., `id(L1) == id(L2)`),
  - Forgotten that some built-in function has a side effect,
  - Forgotten the `()` that turns a reference to an object of type function into a function invocation,
  - Created an unintentional alias, or
- Made any other mistake that is typical for you.
  
- Stop asking yourself why the program isn’t doing what you want it to. Instead, ask yourself why it is doing what it is. 

  ​	That should be an easier question to answer, and will probably be a good first step in figuring out how to fix the program.

- Keep in mind that the bug is probably not where you think it is.

  ​	If it were, you would probably have found it long ago. One practical way to go about deciding where to look is asking where the bug cannot be. As Sherlock Holmes said, “Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.”46

- Try to explain the problem to somebody else.

  ​	We all develop blind spots. It is often the case that merely attempting to explain the problem to someone will lead you to see things you have missed. A good thing to try to explain is why the bug cannot be in certain places.

- Don’t believe everything you read. 

  ​	In particular, don’t believe the documentation. The code may not be doing what the comments suggest.

- Stop debugging and start writing documentation. 

  ​	This will help you approach the problem from a different perspective.

- Walk away, and try again tomorrow. 

  ​	This may mean that bug is fixed later in time than if you had stuck with it, but you will probably spend a lot less of your time looking for it. That is, it is possible to trade latency for efficiency. (Students, this is an excellent reason to start work on programming problem sets earlier rather than later!)

### Why we should resist the temptation to start coding and testing a fix when we have found "the" bug?

Remember that the goal is not to fix one bug, but to move rapidly and efficiently towards a bug-free program.

- Ask yourself if this bug explains all the observed symptoms, or whether it is just the tip of the iceberg. 

  ​	If the latter, it may be better to think about taking care of this bug in concert with other changes.

- Before making any change, try and understand the ramification[^ramification] of the proposed “fix.” 

  ​	Will it break something else? Does it introduce excessive complexity? Does it offer the opportunity to tidy up other parts of the code?

- Always make sure that you can get back to where you are.

- Finally, if there are many unexplained errors, you might consider whether finding and fixing bugs one at a time is even the right approach. 

  ​	Maybe you would be better off thinking about whether there is some better way to organize your program or some simpler algorithm that will be easier to implement correctly.

[^ramification]: **ramification**: The process of branching, or the development of branches or offshoots from a stem; also, the mode of their arrangement.
