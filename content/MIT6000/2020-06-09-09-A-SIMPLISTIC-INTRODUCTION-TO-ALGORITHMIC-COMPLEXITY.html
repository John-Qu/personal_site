<h3>When the most straightforward solution is often not the most efficient, what attitude should one take?</h3>
<p>Computationally efficient algorithms often employ subtle tricks that can make them difficult to understand. Consequently, programmers often increase the conceptual complexity of a program in an effort to reduce its computational complexity.</p>

<h2>9.1 Thinking About Computational Complexity</h2>
<div id="how-to-get-around-the-two-issues-that-speed-of-computer-and-the-efficiency-of-the-python-implementation-on-that-computer" class="section level3">
<h3>How to get around the two issues that speed of computer and the efficiency of the Python implementation on that computer?</h3>
<p>Instead of measuring time in milliseconds, we measure time in terms of the number of basic steps executed by the program. It is a more abstract way to think about the measure of time.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we will use a random access machine as our model of computation. In a random access machine, steps are executed sequentially, one at a time. A step is an operation that takes a fixed amount of time, such as binding a variable to an object, making a comparison, executing an arithmetic operation, or accessing an object in memory.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-deal-with-the-question-that-program-running-time-measurement-depends-on-the-value-of-input" class="section level3">
<h3>How to deal with the question that program running time measurement depends on the value of input?</h3>
<p>We deal with that by moving away from expressing time complexity as a single number and instead relating it to the sizes of the inputs. This allows us to compare the efficiency of two algorithms by talking about how the running time of each grows with respect to the sizes of the inputs.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-about-the-actual-running-time-of-an-algorithm-depends-not-only-upon-the-sizes-of-the-inputs-but-also-upon-their-values" class="section level3">
<h3>How about the actual running time of an algorithm depends not only upon the sizes of the inputs but also upon their values?</h3>
<pre class="python"><code>def linearSearch(L, x): 
    for e in L:
        if e == x: 
            return True
    return False</code></pre>
<p>In general, there are three broad cases to think about:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>best-case</strong> running time is the minimum running time over all the possible inputs of a given size.For <code>linearSearch</code>, usually it is independent of the size of <code>L</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>worst-case</strong> running time is the maximum running time over all the possible inputs of a given size. For <code>linearSearch</code>, the worst-case running time is linear in the size of <code>L</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>By analogy with the definitions of the best-case and worst-case running time,</p>
<p>the <strong>average-case</strong> (also called <strong>expected-case</strong>) running time is the average run- ning time over all possible inputs of a given size. Alternatively, if one has some a <em>priori</em> information about the distribution of input values (e.g., that 90% of the time <code>x</code> is in <code>L</code>), one can take that into account.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="why-people-usually-focus-on-the-worst-case" class="section level3">
<h3>Why people usually focus on the worst case?</h3>
<p>All engineers share a common article of faith, Murphy’s Law: If something can go wrong, it will go wrong. The worst-case provides an <strong>upper bound</strong> on the running time. This is critical in situations where there is a time constraint on how long a computation can take.</p>

<div id="asymptotic-notation" class="section level2">
<h2>9.2 Asymptotic Notation</h2>
<div id="why-do-we-use-asymptotic-notation-as-a-formal-way-to-talk-about-the-relationship-between-the-running-time-of-an-algorithm-and-the-size-of-its-inputs" class="section level3">
<h3>Why do we use asymptotic notation as a formal way to talk about the relationship between the running time of an algorithm and the size of its inputs?</h3>
<p>The underlying motivation is that almost any algorithm is sufficiently efficient when run on small inputs. What we typically need to worry about is the efficiency of the algorithm when run on very large inputs. As a proxy for “very large,” asymptotic notation describes the complexity of an algorithm as the size of its inputs approaches infinity.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-most-commonly-used-asymptotic-notation" class="section level3">
<h3>What is the most commonly used asymptotic notation?</h3>
<p>“Big O” notation is used to give an <strong>upper bound</strong> on the asymptotic<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> growth (often called the <strong>order of growth</strong>) of a function. For example, the formula f(x) ∈ O(x<sup>2</sup>) means that the function f grows no faster than the quadratic polynomial x<sup>2</sup>, in an asymptotic sense.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-do-we-mean-saying-the-complexity-of-fx-is-ox2" class="section level3">
<h3>What do we mean saying “the complexity of f(x) is O(x<sup>2</sup>)”?</h3>
<p>The difference between a function being “in O(x<sup>2</sup>)” and “being O(x<sup>2</sup>)” is subtle but important. Saying that f(x) ∈ O(x<sup>2</sup>) does not preclude the worst-case running time of f from being considerably less than O(x<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>When we say that f(x) is O(x<sup>2</sup>), we are implying that x<sup>2</sup> is both an upper and a lower bound on the asymptotic worst-case running time. This is called a tight bound.</p>

<h2>9.3 Some Important Complexity Classes</h2>
<div id="some-of-the-most-common-instances-of-big-o" class="section level3">
<h3>Some of the most common instances of Big O</h3>
<p>In each case, n is a measure of the size of the inputs to the function.</p>
<ul>
<li>O(1) denotes constant running time.</li>
<li>O(log n) denotes logarithmic running time.</li>
<li>O(n) denotes linear running time.</li>
<li>O(n log n) denotes log-linear running time.</li>
<li>O(n<sup>k</sup>) denotes polynomial running time. Notice that k is a constant.</li>
<li>O(c<sup>n</sup>) denotes exponential running time. Here a constant is being raised to a power based on the size of the input.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example codes for logarithmic complexity</h3>
<pre class="python"><code>def intToStr (i):
   &quot;&quot;&quot; 假设 i 是非负整数
      返回一个表示 i 的十进制字符串
      &quot;&quot;&quot;

   if i == 0:
      return &#39;0&#39;
   result = &#39;&#39;
   while i &gt; 0:
      result = digits [i%10] + result
      i = i//10
   return result</code></pre>
<p>The complexity of intToStr is O(log(i)).</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def addDigits(n):
    &quot;&quot;&quot; Assumes n is a nonnegative int
        Returns the sum of the digits in n&quot;&quot;&quot; 
    stringRep = intToStr(n)
    val = 0
    for c in stringRep:
        val += int(c)
    return val</code></pre>
<p>It runs in time proportional to O(log(n)) + O(log(n)), which makes it O(log(n)).</p>

<div id="example-codes-for-linear-complexity" class="section level3">

        decimal digit.

    val = 0
    for c in s:

<p>It is linear in the length of s, i.e., O(len(s)).</p>

    else:
        return x*factorial(x-1)</code></pre>

<div id="example-codes-for-log-linear-complexity" class="section level3">

<p>The algorithm is a bit subtle. Consider a list of n elements. We can represent any combination of elements by a string of n 0’s and 1’s, where a 1 represents the presence of an element and a 0 its absence. The combination containing no items is represented by a string of all 0’s, the combination containing all of the items is represented by a string of all 1’s, the combination containing only the first and last elements is represented by 100…001, etc.</p>
<p>Generating all sublists of a list L of length n can be done as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate all n-bit binary numbers. These are the numbers from 0 to 2 .</li>
<li>For each of these 2<sup>n</sup> +1 binary numbers, b, generate a list by selecting those n elements of L that have an index corresponding to a 1 in b. For example, if L is [‘x’, ‘y’] and b is 01, generate the list [‘y’].</li>
