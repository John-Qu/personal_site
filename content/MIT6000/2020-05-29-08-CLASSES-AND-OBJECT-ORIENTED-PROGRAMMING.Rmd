### What is the key to object-oriented programming?

Think about objects as collections of both data and the meth- ods that operate on that data.

## 8.1 Abstract Data Types and Classes

### Why bound a set of objects and the operations on those objects together with an abstract data type?

One can pass an object from one part of a program to another, and in doing so provide access not only to the data attributes of the object but also to operations that make it easy to manipulate that data.

### What does a specification of a class's operations do?

The specifications of those operations define an **interface** between the abstract data type and the rest of the program. The interface defines the behavior of the operations—what they do, but not how they do it. The interface thus provides an **abstraction barrier** that isolates the rest of the program from the data structures, algorithms, and code involved in providing a realization of the type abstraction.

### What mechanisms are available for accomplishing the goal of managing complexity in a way that facilitates change?

Decomposition creates structure in a program, and abstraction suppresses detail.

### Why someone has a great leg up in maintaining a software for years?

The key is to suppress the appropriate details. This is where data abstraction hits the mark. 

One can create domain-specific types that provide a convenient abstraction. Ideally, these types capture concepts that will be relevant over the lifetime of a program. If one starts the programming process by devising types that will be relevant months and even decades later, one has a great leg up in maintaining that software.

### What are the comments below the docstring of class and function?

In contrast, the comments below the docstring contain information about the implementation. That information is aimed at programmers who might want to modify the implementation or build subclasses of the class, not at programmers who might want to use the abstraction.

### What is the code of implementation an "intset"?

```{python}
class IntSet(object):
    """An intSet is a set of integers"""
    #Information about the implementation (not the abstraction)
    #Value of the set is represented by a list of ints, self.vals.
    #Each int in the set occurs in self.vals exactly once.
    def __init__(self):
        """Create an empty set of integers""" 
        self.vals = []

    def insert(self, e):
        """Assumes e is an integer and inserts e into self"""
        if e not in self.vals:
            self.vals.append(e)

    def member(self, e):
        """Assumes e is an integer
           Returns True if e is in self, and False otherwise"""
        return e in self.vals

    def remove(self, e):
        """Assumes e is an integer and removes e from self
           Raises ValueError if e is not in self"""
        try:
            self.vals.remove(e)
        except:
            raise ValueError(str(e) + ' not found')

    def getMembers(self):
        """Returns a list containing the elements of self.
           Nothing can be assumed about the order of the elements"""
        return self.vals[:]

    def __str__(self):
        """Returns a string representation of self"""
        self.vals.sort()
        result = ''
        for e in self.vals:
            result = result + str(e) + ','
        return '{' + result[:-1] + '}' #-1 omits trailing comma
```

### What is a function inside a class called?

a method that associated with the class

method attributes of the class

### What is the relationship of type, class, method and function?

A class should not be confused with instances of that class, just as an object of type list should not be confused with the list type.

```{python}
s = IntSet() 
s.insert(3) 
print("Whether '3' exists in 's':", s.member(3))
print ("Type of 'IntSet' is " + str(type (IntSet)) + ".\n" + 
       "Type of 'IntSet.insert' is " + str(type (IntSet.insert)) + ".")
print ("Type of 's' is " + str(type (s)) + ".\n" + 
       "Type of 's.insert' is " + str(type(s.insert)) + ".")
```

### What are method attributes and data attributes?

Method attributes are defined in a class definition, for example `IntSet.member` is an attribute of the class `IntSet`. When the class is instantiated, e.g., by the statement `s = IntSet()`, instance attributes, e.g., `s.member`, are created.

When data attributes are associated with a class we call them class variables. When they are associated with an instance we call them instance variables.

### What is representation-independence?

Data abstraction achieves representation-independence. Think of the im- plementation of an abstract type as having several components:

- Implementations of the methods of the type,
- Data structures that together encode values of the type, and
- Conventions[^convention] about how the implementations of the methods are to use the data structures. A key convention is captured by the representation[^representation] invariant[^invariant].

### What is representation invariant?

The **representation invariant** defines which values of the data attributes correspond to valid representations of class instances. The representation invariant for `IntSet` is that `vals` contains no duplicates. The implementation of `__init__` is responsible for establishing the invariant (which holds on the empty list), and the other methods are responsible for maintaining that invariant. That is why `insert` appends e only if it is not already in `self.vals`. The implementation of `remove` exploits the assumption that the representation invariant is satisfied when `remove` is entered. It calls `list.remove` only once, since the representation invariant guarantees that there is at most one occurrence of `e` in `self.vals`.

[^convention]: **convention**: General agreement or concurrence; arbitrary custom; usage; conventionality.
[^representation]: **representation**: That which represents. Specifically: A description or statement; as, the representation of an historian, of a witness, or an advocate.
[^invariant]: **invariant**: n. (Math.) An invariable quantity; specifically, a function of the coefficients of one or more forms, which remains unaltered, when these undergo suitable linear transformations.  - J. J. Sylvester.

### Is a user-defined class instance hashable?

#### Any instance of a user-defined class is hashable

All instances of user-defined classes are hashable, and therefore can be used as dictionary keys. If no `__hash__` method is provided, the hash value of the object is derived from the function `id`.

### Why abstract data types are a big deal[^a-big-deal]?

They lead to a different way of thinking about organizing large programs. 

#### Rely on abstraction when trying to understand concepts about the world

When we think about the world, we rely on abstractions. In the world of finance people talk about stocks and bonds. In the world of biology people talk about proteins and residues. When trying to understand concepts such as these, we mentally gather together some of the relevant **data and features** of these kinds of objects into one **intellectual package**. For example, we think of bonds as having an interest rate and a maturity date as data attributes. We also think of bonds as having operations such as “set price” and “calculate yield to maturity.” Abstract data types allow us to incorporate this kind of organization into the design of programs.

#### Focus on the centrality of data object rather than functions when designing programs 

Data abstraction encourages program designers to focus on the centrality of data objects rather than functions. Thinking about a program more as a collection of types than as a collection of functions leads to a profoundly different organizing principle. Among other things, it encourages one to think about programming as a process of combining relatively large chunks, since data abstractions typically encompass[^encompass] more functionality than do individual functions. This, in turn, leads us to think of the essence of programming as a process not of writing individual lines of code, but of composing[^compose] abstractions.

#### Reuse abstractions to reduce development time and to yield more reliable programs

The availability of reusable abstractions not only reduces development time, but also usually leads to more reliable programs, because mature software is usually more reliable than new software. For many years, the only program libraries in common use were statistical or scientific. Today, however, there is a great range of available program libraries (especially for Python), often based on a rich set of data abstractions.

[^a-big-deal]: **a big deal**: *informal* *[usually with negative]* a thing considered important: *they don't make a big deal out of minor irritations*. • an important person: *Sam Kinison became a big deal*. • (big deal) used to express one's contempt for something regarded as impressive or important by another person: *“I'll give you an allowance,” he said. “Big deal,” she thought*.
[^encompass]: **encompass**: To circumscribe or go round so as to surround closely; to encircle; to inclose; to environ; as, a ring *encompasses* the finger; an army *encompasses* a city; a voyage *encompassing* the world. - Shak. A question may be *encompassed* with difficulty. - C. J. Smith.
[^compose]: **compose**: To construct by mental labor; to design and execute, or put together, in a manner involving the adaptation of forms of expression to ideas, or to the laws of harmony or proportion; as, to compose a sentence, a sermon, a symphony, or a picture.

### What abstraction might be useful, before rushing in to design a bunch of data structures to keep track of all the students and faculty, ?

Is there an abstraction that covers the common attributes of students, professors, and staff? Some would argue that they are all human. The following code contains a class that incorporates some of the common attributes (name and birthday) of humans.

```{python}
import datetime

class Person(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        """Create a person"""
        self.name = name
        try:
            lastBlank = name.rindex(' ')
            self.lastName = name[lastBlank+1:]
        except:
            self.lastName = name
        self.birthday = None

    def getName(self):
        """Returns self's full name"""
        return self.name

    def getLastName(self):
        """Returns self's last name"""
        return self.lastName

    def setBirthday(self, birthdate):
        """ Assumes birthdate is of type datetime.date
            Sets self's birthday to birthdate"""
        self.birthday = birthdate

    def getAge(self):
        """Returns self's current age in days"""
        if self.birthday == None:
            raise ValueError
        return (datetime.date.today() - self.birthday).days

    def __lt__(self, other):
        """Returns True if self precedes other in alphabetical
            order, and False otherwise. Comparison is based on last
            names, but if these are the same full names are
            compared."""
        if self.lastName == other.lastName:
            return self.name < other.name
        return self.lastName < other.lastName

    def __str__(self):
        """Returns self's name"""
        return self.name
```

### What should we write into the specification of the `__init__` function of a class?

The following code makes use of `Person`.

```{python}
me = Person('Michael Guttag')
him = Person('Barack Hussein Obama')
her = Person('Madonna')
print(him.getLastName()) 
him.setBirthday(datetime.date(1961, 8, 4)) 
her.setBirthday(datetime.date(1958, 8, 16)) 
print(him.getName(), 'is', him.getAge(), 'days old')
```

Notice that whenever `Person` is instantiated[^instance] an argument is supplied to the `__init__` function. In general, when instantiating a class we need to look at the specification of the `__init__` function for that class to know what arguments to supply and what properties those arguments should have.

[^instance]: **instance**: A token; a sign; a symptom or indication. **Syn**. - EXAMPLE, INSTANCE. The discrimination to be made between these two words relates to cases in which we give “instances” or “examples” of things done. An *instance* denotes the single case then “standing” before us; if there be others like it, the word does not express this fact. On the contrary, an *example* is one of an entire class of like things, and should be a true representative or *sample* of that class. Hence, an *example* proves a rule or regular course of things; an *instance* simply points out what may be true only in the case presented. A man's life may be filled up with *examples* of the self-command and kindness which marked his character, and may present only a solitary *instance* of haste or severity. Hence, the word “example” should never be used to describe what stands singly and alone. We do, however, sometimes apply the word *instance* to what is really an *example*, because we are not thinking of the latter under this aspect, but solely as a case which “stands before us.” See PRECEDENT: Something done or said that may serve as an example to authorize a subsequent act of the same kind; an authoritative example. Examples for cases can but direct as precedents only. - Hooker.

### When do we need to overload the `<` operator?

1. Provide the syntactic convenience of writing infix expressions that use `<`;
1. Provides automatic access to any polymorphic method defined using `__lt__`, such as the build-in method `sort`.

## 8.2 Inheritance

### Is there a mechanism for building groups of related abstraction?

Inheritance allows programmers to create a type hierarchy[^hierarchy] in which each type inherits[^inherit] attributes from the types above it in the hierarchy.

[^hierarchy]: **hierarchy**: A body of officials disposed organically in ranks and orders each subordinate to the one above it; a body of ecclesiastical rulers.
[^inherit]: **inherit**:to receive as a right or title descendible by law from an ancestor at his decease.

### Why and how to define a class variable?

```{python}
class MITPerson(Person):

    nextIdNum = 0 #identification number

    def __init__(self, name):
        Person.__init__(self, name)
        self.idNum = MITPerson.nextIdNum
        MITPerson.nextIdNum += 1

    def getIdNum(self):
        return self.idNum

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.idNum < other.idNum

    def isStudent(self):
        return isinstance(self, Student)
```

The instance variable `self.idNum` is initialized using a class variable, `nextIdNum`, that belongs to the class `MITPerson`, rather than to instances of the class. When an instance of `MITPerson` is created, a new instance of `nextIdNum` is not created, but only accumulate one. This allows `__init__` to ensure that each instance of `MITPerson` has a unique `idNum`.

### Why would one ever want to create a class with no new attributes?

```{python}

class Student(MITPerson):
    pass

class UG(Student):
    def __init__(self, name, classYear):
        MITPerson.__init__(self, name)
        self.year = classYear

    def getClass(self):
        return self.year

class Grad(Student):
    pass
```

![image-20200608104319783](/images/2020-05-29-08-CLASSES-AND-OBJECT-ORIENTED-PROGRAMMING//image-20200608104319783.png)

By introducing the class Grad, we gain the ability to create two different kinds of students and use their types to distinguish one kind of object from another. For example, the code

```{python}
p5 = Grad('Buzz Aldrin')
p6 = UG('Billy Beaver', 1984)
print(p5, 'is a graduate student is', type(p5) == Grad) 
print(p5, 'is an undergraduate student is', type(p5) == UG)
```

The utility of the intermediate type Student is a bit subtler. Consider going back to class `MITPerson` and adding the method

```python
class MITPerson(Person):
    # ...
    def isStudent(self):
        return isinstance(self, Student)
```

The function isinstance is built into Python. The first argument of isin- stance can be any object, but the second argument must be an object of type `type`. The function returns `True` if and only if the first argument is an instance of the second argument. For example, the value of `isinstance([1,2], list)` is `True`.

Notice that the meaning of `isinstance(p6, Student)` is quite different from the meaning of `type(p6) == Student`. The object to which `p6` is bound is of type `UG`, not `Student`, but since `UG` is a subclass of `Student`, the object to which `p6` is bound is considered to be an instance of class `Student` (as well as an instance of `MITPerson` and `Person`).

Since there are only two kinds of students, we could have implemented `isStudent` as,

```python
class MITPerson(Person):
    # ...
    def isStudent(self):
        return type(self) == Grad or type(self) == UG
```

However, if a new type of student were introduced at some later point it would be necessary to go back and edit the code implementing isStudent. By in- troducing the intermediate class Student and using isinstance we avoid this prob- lem. For example, if we were to add

```python
class TransferStudent(Student):

    def __init__(self, name, fromSchool):
        MITPerson.__init__(self, name)
        self.fromSchool = fromSchool

    def getOldSchool(self):
        return self.fromSchool
```

no change needs to be made to `isStudent`. It is not unusual during the creation and later maintenance of a program to go back and add new classes or new attributes to old classes. Good programmers design their programs so as to minimize the amount of code that might need to be changed when that is done.

### What should we take care of when we write subclass overriding methods from the superclass?

In particular, important behaviors of the supertype must be supported by each of its subtypes. If client code works correctly using an instance of the supertype, it should also work correctly when an instance of the subtype is substituted for the instance of the supertype.

## 8.3 Encapsulation and Information Hiding

###  How to keep track of the grades of a collection of students?

Instances of class `Grades` are implemented using a list and a dictionary. The list keeps track of the students in the class. The dictionary maps a student’s identification number to a list of grades.

```{python}
class Grades(object):

    def __init__(self):
        """Create empty grade book"""
        self.students = []
        self.grades = {}
        self.isSorted = True

    def addStudent(self, student):
        """Assumes: student is of type Student
            Add student to the grade book"""
        if student in self.students:
            raise ValueError('Duplicate student')
        self.students.append(student)
        self.grades[student.getIdNum()] = []
        self.isSorted = False

    def addGrade(self, student, grade):
        """Assumes: grade is a float
            Add grade to the list of grades for student"""
        try:
            self.grades[student.getIdNum()].append(grade)
        except:
            raise ValueError('Student not in mapping')

    def getGrades(self, student):
        """Return a list of grades for student"""
        try: #return copy of list of student's grades
            return self.grades[student.getIdNum()][:]
        except:
            raise ValueError('Student not in mapping')

    def getStudents(self):
        """Return a sorted list of the students in the grade book"""
        if not self.isSorted:
            self.students.sort()
            self.isSorted = True
        return self.students[:] #return copy of list of students
```

### What is the possible problems if `getStudents` returned `self.students` rather than a copy of the list of students?

Consider the code

```python
allStudents = course1.getStudents() 
allStudents.extend(course2.getStudents())
```

If `getStudents` returned `self.students`, the second line of code would have the (probably unexpected) side effect of changing the set of students in `course1`.

### How to avoid sorting an already sorted list?

The instance variable isSorted is used to keep track of whether or not the list of students has been sorted since the last time a student was added to it. As in

```python
class Grades(object):

    def __init__(self):
        """Create empty grade book"""
        # ...
        self.isSorted = True
    
    def addStudent(self, student):
        """Assumes: student is of type Student
            Add student to the grade book"""
        # ...
        self.isSorted = False

    def getStudents(self):
        """Return a sorted list of the students in the grade book"""
        if not self.isSorted:
            self.students.sort()
            self.isSorted = True
        return self.students[:] #return copy of list of students
```

### How to generate a grade report for some students taking a course named `sixHundred`?

```{python}

def gradeReport(course):
    """Assumes course is of type Grades"""
    report = ''
    for s in course.getStudents():
        tot = 0.0
        numGrades = 0
        for g in course.getGrades(s):
            tot += g
            numGrades += 1
        try:
            average = tot/numGrades
            report = report + '\n'\
                     + str(s) + '\'s mean grade is ' + str(average)
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            report = report + '\n'\
                     + str(s) + ' has no grades'
    return report

ug1 = UG('Jane Doe', 2014)
ug2 = UG('John Doe', 2015)
ug3 = UG('David Henry', 2003)
g1 = Grad('Billy Buckner')
g2 = Grad('Bucky F. Dent')
sixHundred = Grades()
sixHundred.addStudent(ug1)
sixHundred.addStudent(ug2)
sixHundred.addStudent(g1)
sixHundred.addStudent(g2)
for s in sixHundred.getStudents():
    sixHundred.addGrade(s, 75)
sixHundred.addGrade(g1, 25)
sixHundred.addGrade(g2, 100)
sixHundred.addStudent(ug3)
print(gradeReport(sixHundred))
```

### What does "encapsulation" mean in taking it as one of the two concepts at the heart of object-oriented programming?

By this we mean the bundling together of data attributes and the methods for operating on them.

### What is the role of "information hiding" in object-oriented programming?

This is one of the keys to modularity. If those parts of the program that use a class (i.e., the clients of the class) rely only on the specifications of the methods in the class, a programmer implementing the class is free to change the implementation of the class (e.g., to improve efficiency) without worrying that the change will break code that uses the class.

### Dose Python provide mechanisms for enforcing information hiding?

Some programming languages (Java and C++, for example) provide mechanisms for enforcing information hiding. Programmers can make the attributes of a class private, so that clients of the class can access the data only through the object's methods. Python 3 uses a naming convention to make attributes invisible outside the class. When the name of an attribute starts with `__` but does not end with `__`, that attribute is not visible outside the class. Consider the class in the following code.

```{python}
class infoHiding(object):
    """ Test Python's '__' mechanism for information hiding from the outside of class definition. """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.visible = 'Look at me'
        self.__alsoVisible__ = 'Look at me too'
        self.__invisible = 'Don\'t look at me directly'

    def printVisible(self):
        print(self.visible)

    def printInvisible(self):
        print(self.__invisible)

    def __printInvisible(self):
        print(self.__invisible)

    def __printInvisible__(self):
        print(self.__invisible)
```

```{python}
test = infoHiding()
try:
    print(test.visible)
    print(test.__alsoVisible__)
    print(test.__invisible)
except:
    pass
```

```{python}
test = infoHiding()
try:
    test.printInvisible()
    test.__printInvisible__()
    test.__printInvisible()
except:
    pass
```

```{python}
class subClass(infoHiding):

    def __init__(self):
        print('from subclass', self.__invisible)

try:
    testSub = subClass()
except:
    pass    
```


Notice that when a subclass attempts to use a hidden attribute of its superclass an AttributeError occurs. This can make using information hiding in Python a bit cumbersome. Because it can be cumbersome, many Python programmers do not take advantage of the `__` mechanism for hiding attributes—as we don’t in this book. So, for example, a client of Person can write the expression `Rafael.lastName` rather than `Rafael.getLastName()`.

This is unfortunate because it allows the client code to rely upon something that is not part of the specification of `Person`, and is therefore subject to change. If the implementation of `Person` were changed, for example to extract the last name whenever it is requested rather than store it in an instance variable, then the client code would no longer work.

### Is it legal in Python to access(read and write) instance and class variables from outside the class definition?

Yes. While this relatively weak static semantic checking is a flaw in Python, it is not a fatal flaw.

### Is there a better solution in the loss of efficiency when preventing client programs from directly accessing critical data structures?

Any function definition containing a `yield` statement is treated in a special way. The presence of `yield` tells the Python system that the function is a generator.

```python
class Grades(object):
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Create empty grade book"""
        # ...
        self.isSorted = True

    def addStudent(self, student):
        """Assumes: student is of type Student
            Add student to the grade book"""
        # ...
        self.isSorted = False

    # def getStudents(self): # with out yield
        # """Return a sorted list of the students in the grade book"""
        # if not self.isSorted:
            # self.students.sort()
            # self.isSorted = True
        # return self.students[:] #return copy of list of students

    def getStudents(self): # with yield
        """Return the students in the grade book one at a time
in alphabetical order"""
        if not self.isSorted:
            self.students.sort()
            self.isSorted = True
        for s in self.students:
            yield s # return one element once a time
```

Generators are typically used in conjunction with `for` statements, as in

```{python}
book = Grades()
book.addStudent(Grad('Julie'))
book.addStudent(Grad('Charlie'))
for s in book.getStudents():
    print(s)

## 8.4 Mortgages, an Extended Example

### What kinds of loans are there in the mortgage at the end of twentieth century?

Towards the end of the twentieth century, mortgages[^mortgage] started getting a lot more complicated. 

1. People could get lower interest rates by paying “points” to the lender at the time they took on the mortgage. A point is a cash payment of about 1% of the value of the loan. 
1. People could take mortgages that were “interest-only” for a period of time. That is to say, for some number of months at the start of the loan the borrower paid only the accrued interest and none of the principal. 
1. Other loans involved multiple rates. Typically the initial rate (called a “teaser rate”) was low, and then it went up over time. Many of these loans were variable-rate—the rate to be paid after the initial period would vary depending upon some index[^index] intended to reflect the cost to the lender of borrowing on the wholesale credit market.

[^index]: The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is probably the most commonly used index.
[^mortgage]: **mortgage**: It was called a *mortgage* (or *dead pledge*) because, whatever profit it might yield, it did not thereby redeem itself, but became lost or *dead* to the mortgager upon breach of the condition. But in equity a *right of redemption* is an inseparable incident of a mortgage until the mortgager is debarred by his own laches, or by judicial decree. - Cowell. Kent. 之所以称其为抵押（或无抵押），是因为无论它能产生什么利润，它都不会因此赎回自己，而是在违反条件时对抵押人造成损失或死亡。 但是，衡平法上来说，赎回权是抵押的不可分割的事件，直到抵押人被自己的抵押或司法令禁止为止。 科威尔 肯特

### What is the goal of exercising the implementation of three kinds of loans?

The point of this exercise is to provide some experience in the incremental development of a set of related classes, not to make you an expert on mortgages.

Let’s build a program that examines the costs of three kinds of loans: 

1. A fixed-rate mortgage with no points,
1. A fixed-rate mortgage with points, and
1. A mortgage with an initial teaser rate followed by a higher rate for the duration.

### What is abstract class? What does it used for?

We will structure our code to include a `Mortgage` class, and subclasses corresponding to each of the three kinds of mortgages listed above. Figure 8.9 contains the abstract class `Mortgage`. This class contains methods that are shared by each of its subclasses, but it is not intended to be instantiated directly. That is, no objects of type `Mortgage` will be created.

```{python}
def findPayment (loan, r, m):
    """ Assumes: 'loan' and 'r' are floats, 'm' an int
        Returns the monthly payment for a mortgage of size
        'loan' at a monthly rate of 'r' for 'm' months """
    return loan * ((r * (1 + r) ** m) / ((1 + r) ** m - 1))

class Mortgage (object):
    """ Abstract class for building different kinds of mortgages """

    def __init__(self, loan, annRate, months):
        """ Assumes: loan and annRate are floats, months an int 
            Creates a new mortgage of size loan, duration months, and annual rate annRate """
        # Here are three instance initial values
        self.loan = loan
        self.rate = annRate / 12 # Is it an common agreement that annual rate is 12 times of monthly rate?
        self.months = months
        # Here are two lists extended monthly
        self.paid = [0.0] # At the first day of loan you don't need to pay loan. Note this list is extended monthly
        self.outstanding = [loan] # the m th month 本金额 remained to be paid
        # Here is the monthly payment for a mortgage of size 'loan' at monthly rate of 'self.rate' for 'months' months
        self.payment = findPayment (loan, self.rate, months) 
        self.legend = None  # description of certain kind of mortgage

    def makePayment (self):
        """ Make a monthly payment"""
        # Calculate monthly payments then append them to two lists:
        # monthly payments and monthly outstanding loan balance
        self.paid.append (self.payment) 
        # reduction used to reduce the loan balance = monthly payment - the amount of interest due on the outstanding loan balance
        reduction = self.payment - self.outstanding [-1] * self.rate 
        self.outstanding.append (self.outstanding [-1] - reduction) 

    def getTotalPaid (self):
        """ Return the total amount paid so far """
        return sum (self.paid)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.legend
```

### What is a safe attitude when needing a closed-form expression?

This expression is not hard to derive, but it is a lot easier to just look it up and more likely to be correct than one derived on the spot[^on the spot].

[^on the spot]: **On the spot**, *or* **Upon the spot**, immediately; before moving; without changing place; as, he made his decision on the spot.

Keep in mind that not everything you discover on the Web (or even in textbooks) is correct. When your code incorporates a formula that you have looked up, make sure that:

- You have taken the formula from a reputable source. We looked at multiple reputable sources, all of which contained equivalent formulas.
- You fully understand the meaning of all the variables in the formula.
- You test your implementation against examples taken from reputable sources. After implementing this function, we tested it by comparing our results to the results supplied by a calculator available on the Web.

### How concrete subclasses inherit attributes from abstract superclass?

No need to repeat the same specification of superclass in `__init__` of subclass? I think it is better to mention again and to point out what each argument is like.   

```{python}
class Fixed (Mortgage):
    """ A fixed-rate mortgage with no points. """
    
    def __init__(self, loan, r, months):
        """ No need to repeat the same specification of superclass? """
        Mortgage.__init__(self, loan, r, months)
        self.legend = 'Fixed, ' + str (round (r*100, 2)) + '%'

class FixedWithPts (Mortgage):
    """ A fixed-rate mortgage with points. """
    def __init__(self, loan, r, months, pts):
        """
        :param loan: floats, size of mortgage
        :param r: floats without percentage symbol, annual rate
        :param months: int, total duration
        :param pts: float with percentage symbol,
            payment points of the initial loan
        :return: a new instance of FixedWithPts of type Mortgage
        """
        Mortgage.__init__(self, loan, r, months)
        self.pts = pts # points as service fee
        self.paid = [loan*(pts/100)] # Override Mortgage's init 0.0. /
            # Note that this part of payment is not used to reduce the /
            # outstanding of loan balance.
        self.legend = 'Fixed, ' + str (round (r*100, 2)) + '%, '\
                      + str (pts) + ' points'

class TwoRate (Mortgage):
    """ A mortgage with an initial teaser rate followed by a higher rate for the duration. """
    
    def __init__(self, loan, r, months, teaserRate, teaserMonths):
        """ Initiate with teaser rate and total months, and calculate monthly payment to the end
        :param loan: float, size of mortgage
        :param r: floats without percentage symbol, annual rate
        :param months: int, total duration
        :param teaserRate: float without percentage symbol,
            annual teaser rate in the teaser months
        :param teaserMonths: int, teaser duration
        :return an instance of TwoRate under super class of Mortgage
        """
        Mortgage.__init__(self, loan, teaserRate, months) 
        self.teaserMonths = teaserMonths
        self.teaserRate = teaserRate
        self.nextRate = r/12
        self.legend = str (teaserRate*100)\
                     + '% for ' + str (self.teaserMonths)\
                     + ' months, then ' + str (round (r*100, 2)) + '%'
                
    def makePayment (self):
        """
        When time is up, replace teaser rate with next rate, and
        calculate monthly payment again with new loan, new rate and
        new months.
        """
        if len (self.paid) == self.teaserMonths + 1:
           self.rate = self.nextRate
           self.payment = findPayment (self.outstanding [-1],
                                   self.rate,
                                   self.months - self.teaserMonths)
        Mortgage.makePayment (self) # Call the superclass method with instance itself
```

The above three mortgage is clear with each parameters.

```{python}
def compareMortgages (amt, years, fixedRate, pts, ptsRate,
                     varRate1, varRate2, varMonths):
    """
    Print out three kinds of mortgages with their total payments
    :param amt: int, amount of loan size

    :param pts: float with percent symbol, payment points of the initial loan
    :param ptsRate: float without percent symbol, fixed annual rate with
     points payment
    :param varRate1: float without percentage symbol, annual teaser rate in
     the teaser months
    :param varRate2: floats without percentage symbol, annual rate

    """
    totMonths = years*12
    fixed = Fixed (amt, fixedRate, totMonths)
    fixedwithpts = FixedWithPts (amt, ptsRate, totMonths, pts)
    twoRate = TwoRate (amt, varRate2, totMonths, varRate1, varMonths)
    morts = [fixed, fixedwithpts, twoRate]
    for month in range (totMonths):
        for mort in morts:
            mort.makePayment ()
    for mort in morts:
        print (mort)
        print (' Total payments = $' + str (int (mort.getTotalPaid ())))

compareMortgages (amt=200000, years=30, fixedRate=0.07,
                 pts = 3.25, ptsRate=0.05, varRate1=0.045,
                 varRate2=0.095, varMonths=48)
```
