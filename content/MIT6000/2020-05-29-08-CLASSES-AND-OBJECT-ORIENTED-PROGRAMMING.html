<div id="what-is-the-key-to-object-oriented-programming" class="section level3">
<h3>What is the key to object-oriented programming?</h3>
<p>Think about objects as collections of both data and the meth- ods that operate on that data.</p>
</div>
<div id="abstract-data-types-and-classes" class="section level2">
<h2>8.1 Abstract Data Types and Classes</h2>
<div id="why-bound-a-set-of-objects-and-the-operations-on-those-objects-together-with-an-abstract-data-type" class="section level3">
<h3>Why bound a set of objects and the operations on those objects together with an abstract data type?</h3>
<p>One can pass an object from one part of a program to another, and in doing so provide access not only to the data attributes of the object but also to operations that make it easy to manipulate that data.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-does-a-specification-of-a-classs-operations-do" class="section level3">
<h3>What does a specification of a class’s operations do?</h3>
<p>The specifications of those operations define an <strong>interface</strong> between the abstract data type and the rest of the program. The interface defines the behavior of the operations—what they do, but not how they do it. The interface thus provides an <strong>abstraction barrier</strong> that isolates the rest of the program from the data structures, algorithms, and code involved in providing a realization of the type abstraction.</p>

<div id="what-mechanisms-are-available-for-accomplishing-the-goal-of-managing-complexity-in-a-way-that-facilitates-change" class="section level3">
<h3>What mechanisms are available for accomplishing the goal of managing complexity in a way that facilitates change?</h3>
<p>Decomposition creates structure in a program, and abstraction suppresses detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-someone-has-a-great-leg-up-in-maintaining-a-software-for-years" class="section level3">
<h3>Why someone has a great leg up in maintaining a software for years?</h3>
<p>The key is to suppress the appropriate details. This is where data abstraction hits the mark.</p>
<p>One can create domain-specific types that provide a convenient abstraction. Ideally, these types capture concepts that will be relevant over the lifetime of a program. If one starts the programming process by devising types that will be relevant months and even decades later, one has a great leg up in maintaining that software.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-the-comments-below-the-docstring-of-class-and-function" class="section level3">
<h3>What are the comments below the docstring of class and function?</h3>
<p>In contrast, the comments below the docstring contain information about the implementation. That information is aimed at programmers who might want to modify the implementation or build subclasses of the class, not at programmers who might want to use the abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-code-of-implementation-an-intset" class="section level3">
<h3>What is the code of implementation an “intset”?</h3>

<h3>What is the relationship of type, class, method and function?</h3>
<p>A class should not be confused with instances of that class, just as an object of type list should not be confused with the list type.</p>

</div>
<div id="what-are-method-attributes-and-data-attributes" class="section level3">
<h3>What are method attributes and data attributes?</h3>
<p>Method attributes are defined in a class definition, for example <code>IntSet.member</code> is an attribute of the class <code>IntSet</code>. When the class is instantiated, e.g., by the statement <code>s = IntSet()</code>, instance attributes, e.g., <code>s.member</code>, are created.</p>
<p>When data attributes are associated with a class we call them class variables. When they are associated with an instance we call them instance variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-representation-independence" class="section level3">
<h3>What is representation-independence?</h3>
<p>Data abstraction achieves representation-independence. Think of the im- plementation of an abstract type as having several components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementations of the methods of the type,</li>
<li>Data structures that together encode values of the type, and</li>
<li>Conventions<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> about how the implementations of the methods are to use the data structures. A key convention is captured by the representation<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> invariant<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="what-is-representation-invariant" class="section level3">
<h3>What is representation invariant?</h3>
<p>The <strong>representation invariant</strong> defines which values of the data attributes correspond to valid representations of class instances. The representation invariant for <code>IntSet</code> is that <code>vals</code> contains no duplicates. The implementation of <code>__init__</code> is responsible for establishing the invariant (which holds on the empty list), and the other methods are responsible for maintaining that invariant. That is why <code>insert</code> appends e only if it is not already in <code>self.vals</code>. The implementation of <code>remove</code> exploits the assumption that the representation invariant is satisfied when <code>remove</code> is entered. It calls <code>list.remove</code> only once, since the representation invariant guarantees that there is at most one occurrence of <code>e</code> in <code>self.vals</code>.</p>

<h3>Is a user-defined class instance hashable?</h3>
<div id="any-instance-of-a-user-defined-class-is-hashable" class="section level4">
<h4>Any instance of a user-defined class is hashable</h4>
<p>All instances of user-defined classes are hashable, and therefore can be used as dictionary keys. If no <code>__hash__</code> method is provided, the hash value of the object is derived from the function <code>id</code>.</p>

<div id="why-abstract-data-types-are-a-big-deala-big-deal" class="section level3">
<h3>Why abstract data types are a big deal<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>?</h3>
<p>They lead to a different way of thinking about organizing large programs.</p>
<div id="rely-on-abstraction-when-trying-to-understand-concepts-about-the-world" class="section level4">
<h4>Rely on abstraction when trying to understand concepts about the world</h4>
<p>When we think about the world, we rely on abstractions. In the world of finance people talk about stocks and bonds. In the world of biology people talk about proteins and residues. When trying to understand concepts such as these, we mentally gather together some of the relevant <strong>data and features</strong> of these kinds of objects into one <strong>intellectual package</strong>. For example, we think of bonds as having an interest rate and a maturity date as data attributes. We also think of bonds as having operations such as “set price” and “calculate yield to maturity.” Abstract data types allow us to incorporate this kind of organization into the design of programs.</p>
</div>
<div id="focus-on-the-centrality-of-data-object-rather-than-functions-when-designing-programs" class="section level4">
<h4>Focus on the centrality of data object rather than functions when designing programs</h4>
<p>Data abstraction encourages program designers to focus on the centrality of data objects rather than functions. Thinking about a program more as a collection of types than as a collection of functions leads to a profoundly different organizing principle. Among other things, it encourages one to think about programming as a process of combining relatively large chunks, since data abstractions typically encompass<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> more functionality than do individual functions. This, in turn, leads us to think of the essence of programming as a process not of writing individual lines of code, but of composing<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div id="reuse-abstractions-to-reduce-development-time-and-to-yield-more-reliable-programs" class="section level4">
<h4>Reuse abstractions to reduce development time and to yield more reliable programs</h4>
<p>The availability of reusable abstractions not only reduces development time, but also usually leads to more reliable programs, because mature software is usually more reliable than new software. For many years, the only program libraries in common use were statistical or scientific. Today, however, there is a great range of available program libraries (especially for Python), often based on a rich set of data abstractions.</p>

<h3>What abstraction might be useful, before rushing in to design a bunch of data structures to keep track of all the students and faculty, ?</h3>
<p>Is there an abstraction that covers the common attributes of students, professors, and staff? Some would argue that they are all human. The following code contains a class that incorporates some of the common attributes (name and birthday) of humans.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import datetime

        &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns True if self precedes other in alphabetical
            order, and False otherwise. Comparison is based on last
            names, but if these are the same full names are
            compared.&quot;&quot;&quot;
        if self.lastName == other.lastName:
            return self.name &lt; other.name
        return self.lastName &lt; other.lastName

    def __str__(self):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns self&#39;s name&quot;&quot;&quot;
        return self.name</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="what-should-we-write-into-the-specification-of-the-__init__-function-of-a-class" class="section level3">
<h3>What should we write into the specification of the <code>__init__</code> function of a class?</h3>

<p>Notice that whenever <code>Person</code> is instantiated<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> an argument is supplied to the <code>__init__</code> function.

<div id="why-and-how-to-define-a-class-variable" class="section level3">
<h3>Why and how to define a class variable?</h3>
<pre class="python"><code>class MITPerson(Person):

    nextIdNum = 0 #identification number

    def __init__(self, name):
        Person.__init__(self, name)
        self.idNum = MITPerson.nextIdNum
        MITPerson.nextIdNum += 1

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.idNum &lt; other.idNum

    def isStudent(self):
        return isinstance(self, Student)</code></pre>
<p>The instance variable <code>self.idNum</code> is initialized using a class variable, <code>nextIdNum</code>, that belongs to the class <code>MITPerson</code>, rather than to instances of the class. When an instance of <code>MITPerson</code> is created, a new instance of <code>nextIdNum</code> is not created, but only accumulate one. This allows <code>__init__</code> to ensure that each instance of <code>MITPerson</code> has a unique <code>idNum</code>.</p>

<div id="why-would-one-ever-want-to-create-a-class-with-no-new-attributes" class="section level3">
<h3>Why would one ever want to create a class with no new attributes?</h3>
<pre class="python"><code>
class Student(MITPerson):
    pass

class UG(Student):
    def __init__(self, name, classYear):
        MITPerson.__init__(self, name)
        self.year = classYear

    def getClass(self):
        return self.year

<p class="caption">image-20200608104319783</p>
</div>
<p>By introducing the class Grad, we gain the ability to create two different kinds of students and use their types to distinguish one kind of object from another. For example, the code</p>
<pre class="python"><code>p5 = Grad(&#39;Buzz Aldrin&#39;)
p6 = UG(&#39;Billy Beaver&#39;, 1984)
print(p5, &#39;is a graduate student is&#39;, type(p5) == Grad) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## Buzz Aldrin is a graduate student is True</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>print(p5, &#39;is an undergraduate student is&#39;, type(p5) == UG)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Buzz Aldrin is an undergraduate student is False</code></pre>
<p>The utility of the intermediate type Student is a bit subtler. Consider going back to class <code>MITPerson</code> and adding the method</p>
<pre class="python"><code>class MITPerson(Person):
    # ...
    def isStudent(self):
        return isinstance(self, Student)</code></pre>
<p>The function isinstance is built into Python. The first argument of isin- stance can be any object, but the second argument must be an object of type <code>type</code>. The function returns <code>True</code> if and only if the first argument is an instance of the second argument. For example, the value of <code>isinstance([1,2], list)</code> is <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>Notice that the meaning of <code>isinstance(p6, Student)</code> is quite different from the meaning of <code>type(p6) == Student</code>. The object to which <code>p6</code> is bound is of type <code>UG</code>, not <code>Student</code>, but since <code>UG</code> is a subclass of <code>Student</code>, the object to which <code>p6</code> is bound is considered to be an instance of class <code>Student</code> (as well as an instance of <code>MITPerson</code> and <code>Person</code>).</p>
<p>Since there are only two kinds of students, we could have implemented <code>isStudent</code> as,</p>
<pre class="python"><code>class MITPerson(Person):
    # ...
    def isStudent(self):
        return type(self) == Grad or type(self) == UG</code></pre>
<p>However, if a new type of student were introduced at some later point it would be necessary to go back and edit the code implementing isStudent. By in- troducing the intermediate class Student and using isinstance we avoid this prob- lem. For example, if we were to add</p>
<pre class="python"><code>class TransferStudent(Student):

    def __init__(self, name, fromSchool):
        MITPerson.__init__(self, name)
        self.fromSchool = fromSchool

    def getOldSchool(self):
        return self.fromSchool</code></pre>
<p>no change needs to be made to <code>isStudent</code>. It is not unusual during the creation and later maintenance of a program to go back and add new classes or new attributes to old classes. Good programmers design their programs so as to minimize the amount of code that might need to be changed when that is done.</p>

<h3>What does “encapsulation” mean in taking it as one of the two concepts at the heart of object-oriented programming?</h3>
<p>By this we mean the bundling together of data attributes and the methods for operating on them.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-role-of-information-hiding-in-object-oriented-programming" class="section level3">
<h3>What is the role of “information hiding” in object-oriented programming?</h3>
<p>This is one of the keys to modularity. If those parts of the program that use a class (i.e., the clients of the class) rely only on the specifications of the methods in the class, a programmer implementing the class is free to change the implementation of the class (e.g., to improve efficiency) without worrying that the change will break code that uses the class.</p>
</div>
<div id="dose-python-provide-mechanisms-for-enforcing-information-hiding" class="section level3">
<h3>Dose Python provide mechanisms for enforcing information hiding?</h3>
<p>Some programming languages (Java and C++, for example) provide mechanisms for enforcing information hiding. Programmers can make the attributes of a class private, so that clients of the class can access the data only through the object’s methods. Python 3 uses a naming convention to make attributes invisible outside the class. When the name of an attribute starts with <code>__</code> but does not end with <code>__</code>, that attribute is not visible outside the class. Consider the class in the following code.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>class infoHiding(object):
    &quot;&quot;&quot; Test Python&#39;s &#39;__&#39; mechanism for information hiding from the outside of class definition. &quot;&quot;&quot;
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.visible = &#39;Look at me&#39;
        self.__alsoVisible__ = &#39;Look at me too&#39;
        self.__invisible = &#39;Don\&#39;t look at me directly&#39;

    def printVisible(self):
        print(self.visible)

    def printInvisible(self):
        print(self.__invisible)

    def __printInvisible(self):
        print(self.__invisible)

    def __printInvisible__(self):
        print(self.__invisible)</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>test = infoHiding()
try:
    print(test.visible)
    print(test.__alsoVisible__)
    print(test.__invisible)
except:
    pass</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Look at me
## Look at me too</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>test = infoHiding()
try:
    test.printInvisible()
    test.__printInvisible__()
    test.__printInvisible()
except:
    pass</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Don&#39;t look at me directly
## Don&#39;t look at me directly</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>class subClass(infoHiding):

    def __init__(self):
        print(&#39;from subclass&#39;, self.__invisible)

try:
    testSub = subClass()
except:
    pass    </code></pre>
<p>Notice that when a subclass attempts to use a hidden attribute of its superclass an AttributeError occurs. This can make using information hiding in Python a bit cumbersome. Because it can be cumbersome, many Python programmers do not take advantage of the <code>__</code> mechanism for hiding attributes—as we don’t in this book. So, for example, a client of Person can write the expression <code>Rafael.lastName</code> rather than <code>Rafael.getLastName()</code>.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate because it allows the client code to rely upon something that is not part of the specification of <code>Person</code>, and is therefore subject to change. If the implementation of <code>Person</code> were changed, for example to extract the last name whenever it is requested rather than store it in an instance variable, then the client code would no longer work.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>People could get lower interest rates by paying “points” to the lender at the time they took on the mortgage. A point is a cash payment of about 1% of the value of the loan.</li>
<li>People could take mortgages that were “interest-only” for a period of time. That is to say, for some number of months at the start of the loan the borrower paid only the accrued interest and none of the principal.</li>
<li>Other loans involved multiple rates. Typically the initial rate (called a “teaser rate”) was low, and then it went up over time. Many of these loans were variable-rate—the rate to be paid after the initial period would vary depending upon some index<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> intended to reflect the cost to the lender of borrowing on the wholesale credit market.</li>
