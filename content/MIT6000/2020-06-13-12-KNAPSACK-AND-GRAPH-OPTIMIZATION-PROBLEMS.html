<h3>What are the characters of optimization problem?</h3>
<p>In general, an optimization problem has two parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An objective function that is to be maximized or minimized. For example, the airfare<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> between Boston and Istanbul.</li>
<li>A set of constraints (possibly empty) that must be honored<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. For example, an upper bound<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> on the travel time.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="whats-the-main-things-to-take-away-from-this-chapter" class="section level3">
<h3>What’s the main things to take away from this chapter?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many problems of real importance can be formulated in a simple way that leads naturally to a computational solution.</li>
<li>Reducing a seemingly new problem to an instance of a well-known problem allows one to use preexisting solutions.</li>
<li>Knapsack problems and graph problems are classes of problems to which other problems can often be reduced.</li>
<li>Exhaustive enumeration algorithms provide a simple, but often computationally intractable, way to search for optimal solutions.</li>
<li>A greedy algorithm is often a practical approach to finding a pretty good, but not always optimal, solution to an optimization problem.</li>

<div id="why-it-is-not-easy-being-a-burglar" class="section level3">
<h3>Why it is not easy being a burglar?</h3>
<p>In addition to the obvious problems (making sure that a home is empty, picking locks, circumventing alarms, dealing with ethical quandaries, etc.), a burglar has to decide what to steal. The problem is that most homes contain more things of value than the average burglar can carry away. What’s a poor burglar to do? He needs to find the set of things that provides the most value without exceeding his carrying capacity. Suppose for example, a burglar who has a knapsack that can hold at most 20 pounds of loot<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> breaks into a house and finds the items in Figure 12.1. Clearly, he will not be able to fit it all in his knapsack, so he needs to decide what to take and what to leave behind.</p>

<h3>What is the basic concept behind greedy algorithm?</h3>
<p>The thief would choose the best item first, then the next best, and continue until he reached his limit. Of course, before doing this, the thief would have to decide what “best” should mean. Is the best item the most valuable, the least heavy, or maybe the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio?</p>
<p>Don’t under look a greedy algorithm. It is an algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>It sets the ruler to compare: the best.</li>
<li>It shows the order of actions: one by one.</li>
<li>It puts clear boundary: carry weight.</li>

<h3>What is the essence of a greedy algorithm in compare with this power set algorithm?</h3>
<p>The essence of a greedy algorithm is making the best (as defined by some metric) local choice at each step. It makes a choice that is locally optimal. However, as this example illustrates, a series of locally optimal decisions does not always lead to a solution that is globally optimal.</p>

<h3>Why are greedy algorithms often used in practice, despite the fact that they do not always find the best solution?</h3>
<p>They are usually easier to implement and more efficient to run than algorithms guaranteed to find optimal solutions. As Ivan Boesky once said, “I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.”</p>

<div id="in-what-case-a-greedy-by-density-algorithm-will-always-find-the-optimal-solution" class="section level3">
<h3>In what case, a greedy-by-density algorithm will always find the optimal solution?</h3>
<p>There is a variant of the knapsack problem, called the fractional (or continuous) knapsack problem. Since the items are infinitely divisible, it always makes sense to take as much as possible of the item with the highest remaining value-to-weight ratio.</p>

<h4>graph, node/vertex, edge/arc</h4>
<p>A graph is a set of objects called nodes (or vertices) connected by a set of edges (or arcs).</p>

<div id="digraph-sourceparent-destinationchild" class="section level4">
<h4>digraph, source/parent, destination/child</h4>
<p>If the edges are unidirectional the graph is called a directed graph or digraph. In a directed graph, if there is an edge from n1 to n2, we refer to n1 as the source or parent node and n2 as the destination or child node.</p>

<div id="what-is-eulers-insight-into-the-problem-of-königsberg-bridges-problem" class="section level3">
<h3>What is Euler’s insight into the problem of Königsberg bridges problem?</h3>
<p>Euler’s great insight was that the problem could be vastly simplified by view- ing each separate landmass as a point (think “node”) and each bridge as a line (think “edge”) connecting two of these points. The map of the town could then be represented by the graph to the right of the map in Figure 12.6. Euler then reasoned that if a walk were to traverse each edge exactly once, it must be the case that each node in the middle of the walk (i.e., any island that is both entered and exited during the walk) must be connected by an even number of edges. Since none of the nodes in this graph has an even number of edges, Euler concluded that it is impossible to traverse each bridge exactly once.</p>

<h3>How to use graph theory to help understand problems? Give some examples.</h3>
<p>Only one small extension to the kind of graph used by Euler is needed to model a country’s highway system. If a weight is associated with each edge in a graph (or digraph) it is called a weighted graph. Using weighted graphs, the highway system can be represented as a graph in which cities are represented by nodes and the highways connecting them as edges, where each edge is labeled with the distance between the two nodes. More generally, one can represent any road map (including those with one-way streets) by a weighted digraph.</p>
<p>Similarly, the structure of the World Wide Web can be represented as a digraph in which the nodes are Web pages and there is an edge from node 𝐴 to node 𝐵 if and only if there is a link to page 𝐵 on page 𝐴. Traffic patterns could be modeled by adding a weight to each edge indicating how often is it used.</p>
<p>There are also many less obvious uses of graphs. Biologists use graphs to model things ranging from the way proteins interact with each other to gene ex- pression networks. Physicists use graphs to describe phase transitions. Epidemi- ologists use graphs to model disease trajectories. And so on.</p>

<h3>How to represent the <code>Digraph</code> in computer? What is the choice of its data structure?</h3>
<p>One important decision is the choice of data structure used to represent a <code>Digraph</code>. One common representation is an n × n adjacency matrix, where n is the number of nodes in the graph. Each cell of the matrix contains information (e.g., weights) about the edges connecting the pair of nodes &lt;𝑖, 𝑗&gt;. If the edges are unweighted, each entry is <code>True</code> if and only if there is an edge from 𝑖 to 𝑗.</p>
<p>Another common representation is an adjacency list, which we use here. Class <code>Digraph</code> has two instance variables. The variable <code>nodes</code> is a Python list containing the names of the nodes in the <code>Digraph</code>. The connectivity of the nodes is represented using an adjacency list implemented as a dictionary. The variable <code>edges</code> is a dictionary that maps each <code>Node</code> in the <code>Digraph</code> to a list of the children of that <code>Node</code>.</p>
