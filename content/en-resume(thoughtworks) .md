## EXPERIENCE

### CAD tools <u>coach</u>, 2017.03 ~ now, Shanghai Grape Graph Information Technology Co., Ltd.

- Translated *[FreeCAD For Inventors](https://www.amazon.com/FreeCAD-Inventors-Practical-Examples-Descriptions-ebook/dp/B07H9RV5X6)*[^not the worst commercial tutorial], and made FC 0.17 Chinese version available on [bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/johnqu1982/FFI/) with the permission of publisher after negotiating with the author.
- Translate *[the FreeCAD Manual](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Manual:Introduction)* on its wiki pages, now half of them finished.
- Solved the B-spline curve with [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) for virtual cams in [Tetra Pak A3/Flex filling machine](https://www.tetrapak.com/packaging/tetra-pak-a3flex)'s drive unit that specifying cyclic behavior on velocity and relative positions according to a slide report on [mscsoftware.com](http://www.mscsoftware.com/sites/default/files/metodi-strumenti-calcolo-prototipaz.pdf), need to refactor code and document project.
- Develop an add-on called CamDesign for FreeCAD to generate splines for cam profiles.
- Use FreeCAD version 0.19 to do real world equipment modeling with a case from Tetra Pak A3/Flex filling machine's jaw system and drive unit.
- Use Blender to simulate the process of cam mechanism motion and package transformation in Tetra Pak A3/Flex filling machine.
- Use open-source packages to do engineering calculations for the drive unit in A3/Flex filling machine.

[^not the worst commercial tutorial]: FreeCAD has the score of 4.55 out of 10 ratings, better than two others of 3.2 and 3.8, according to [3 Best New FreeCAD eBooks To Read In 2020](https://bookauthority.org/books/new-freecad-ebooks)

### Territory Account Executive, 2015.10 ~ 2017.02, Nidec Tosok (Shanghai) International Trade Co., Ltd. Measuring Equipments Business

- Initially as technical support, later as the project manager, worked closely with factory colleagues and two partner teams to install and debug a new pump assembly line for Sanyo air conditioner compressor factory, which included 24 functional locations with a cost of 12 million and came to partial acceptance after 16 months during which it had been either in production or in transformations.
- As an account executive in centering machine business, served six customers in four cities: Sanyo in Shenyang, LG and OTIS in Tianjin, Panasonic and BorgWarner in Dalian, and Rechi in Qingdao. Talked out for customers, laughed by colleagues.
- As a pre-sales technical support, participating in the bidding of measuring machines in cylinder block and head production lines, served the major engine factories of Dongfeng, Nissan, and Honda, and became the translator and cushion between customers and the factory; Being assigned to open up new markets, cold-called Kunming Yunnei Power, Liuzhou Wuling, Changsha BYD and Fiat, and got warmly welcomed.

### Equipment Manufacturing Engineer, 2012.06 ~ 2015.09, Shanghai Daichi-Seiko Molding Co., Ltd., Production Equipment Department

- Took in charge of the first trial manufacture of a withstand voltage checking machine for antenna coaxial cable terminal, solved the issues such as product scratches, motor step losing, and electrostatic adsorption, modified drawings, rearranged lists and fed back to the Japanese designer.
- As one of the equipment manufacturing engineers who provide molding and assembly automatic machinery for the mass production of electronic and electrical connectors, kept the actual dimensions of each essential part and noted the adjustment method of each critical relationship, to ensure it is easy to maintain and modify during the life of machines.
- Wrote training reports as a new assembly worker which later became training materials for new employees, and left twenty A6 size working notes of data and drawings in three and a half years.

### Machine localization developer, 2009.03 ~ 2012.05, Shanghai Precise Packaging Co., Ltd., Filling Machine Division

- With technical supervision from CTO, I chose to rebuild the Tetra Pak A3/Flex machine according to its *Spare Parts Catalog* and *Maintenance Manual.* I evolved the jaw system & drive unit with three editions into about 300 parts in half a year. After that, regarding the data of Tetra Pak's mechanical cam profile from CMM, I tried to deduce the functions of its virtual cam motions with Scilab but failed in proofing its usefulness.
- Tetra Pak's products monopolize the dairy industry. As an R & D engineer, with an idea from my supervisor to circumvent Tetra Pak's patents of its out-feed station, I implemented an experimental mechanism, which doesn't work all the time. Precise collaborated with Shanghai Jiaotong University in self-developing both high-speed and flexible filling machines. As a bridge between school and enterprise, I served the test runs, which unfortunately of little avail.
- Seconded to the General Manager's Office, I assisted GF Securities in preparing materials for landing on the stock market. Precise got listed on the Sci-Tech innovation board in April 2015.
